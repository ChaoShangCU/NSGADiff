The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that consists of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine having an alpha-L-fucosyl residue attached at position 3 and a 3-sulfated beta-D-galactosyl residue attached at position 4; beta-D-Galp3S-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)]-D-GlcpNAc in which the configuration at the anomeric centre of the reducing-end residue is beta. It has a role as an epitope.
