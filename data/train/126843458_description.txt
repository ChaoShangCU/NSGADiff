The molecule is an alpha-D-glucoside that is the 2-aminoethyl glycoside of a pentasaccharide consisting of alpha-D-galactosyl, beta-D-glucuronosyl, beta-D-glucosyl, alpha-D-glucosyl and alpha-D-galactosyl residues, all linked sequentially (1->4). It is an alpha-D-galactoside and a pentasaccharide derivative.
