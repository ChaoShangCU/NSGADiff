The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 15-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-icosatetraenoic acid. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-15-HETE. It is a conjugate acid of a 15-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-icosatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
