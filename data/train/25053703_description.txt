The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is 5-amino-2-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone in which one of the hydrogens of the methyl group is replaced by a 2-methyl-4-[(1R,2S)-1,2,3-trimethylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl]but-1-en-1-yl group and one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a 3-methylbutyl group. It is isolated from an Okinawan sponge Spongia sp.SS-1037 and exhibits moderate cytotoxicity against L1210 murine leukemia and KB human epidermoid carcinoma cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones, a sesquiterpenoid and a secondary amino compound.
