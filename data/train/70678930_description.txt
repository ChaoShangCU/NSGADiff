The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of a beta-D-galactose residue (1->3)-linked to the reducing-end GalNAc residue of a linear chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues linked (1->4) and (1->6) respectively. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
