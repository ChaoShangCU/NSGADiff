The molecule is a tetracycline-based broad-spectrum antibiotic. It is approximately 5000 times more soluble than tetracycline base and is unique amongst tetracyclines in that it is absorbed by the "active transport" process across the intestinal wall. It has a role as a protein synthesis inhibitor, an antiprotozoal drug, an antibacterial drug and an antimicrobial agent. It is a member of tetracyclines and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
