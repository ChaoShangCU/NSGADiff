The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of a linear sequence of two alpha-sialyl residues, a beta-Dgalactosyl residue and an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue linked respectively (2->8), (2->8) and (1->4), to the galactosyl residue of which is also linked (1->4) an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue. It is the carbohydrate portion of ganglioside GD2 with undefined anomeric stereochemistry at the reducing-end galactose residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino oligosaccharide and an amino pentasaccharide.
