The molecule is a diterpenoid obtained by formal oxidation of the CH2OH group of (E,E,E)-geranylgeraniol to the corresponding carboxylic acid. It is a diterpenoid, a methyl-branched fatty acid, a trienoic fatty acid and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. It derives from an (E,E,E)-geranylgeraniol. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,6E,10E)-geranylgeranate.
