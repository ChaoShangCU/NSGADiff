The molecule is a member of the class of indazoles that is linifanib in which the 2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl group has been replaced by a 2-methylphenyl group. A cell-permeable 3-aminoindazolylurea compound, it acts as a potent and ATP-competitive inhibitor of VEGFR2/KDR (IC50 = 3 nM) as well as Flt3 and cKit (IC50 = 4 to 20 nM). Shown to block VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in 3T3-murine fibroblasts in vitro. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of indazoles, a ring assembly, an aromatic amine and a member of phenylureas.
