The molecule is a viscumneoside that is homoeriodictyol in which the hydroxy group at position 7 has been converted to the corresponding (6-O-acetyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside. Found in Viscum coloratum, an evergreen hemiparasitic plant whose stems and leaves are used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatism. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a viscumneoside, a flavanone glycoside, a member of phenols, an acetate ester and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a homoeriodictyol and a 6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucose.
