The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin isolated from the aerial parts of Dianthus versicolor. It has been shown to exhibit cytotoxic activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a carboxylic ester, a hydroxy carboxylic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a tetrasaccharide derivative and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid and a 16alpha-hydroxygypsogenic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
