The molecule is a secoiridoid glycoside that is [(2R,3R,4S)-2-hydroxy-5-(methoxycarbonyl)-3-vinyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-4-yl]acetic acid in which the anometric hydroxy group has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucoside. It has been isolated from several plant species and exhibits antioxidant and anti-allergic properties. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antioxidant and an anti-allergic agent. It is a methyl ester, a member of pyrans, an enoate ester, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a dicarboxylic acid monoester and a secoiridoid glycoside.
