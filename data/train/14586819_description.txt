The molecule is a dipeptide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2S,5S)-5-(aminomethyl)-5-hydroxy-6-oxopiperidine-2-carboxylic acid (tabtoxinine-delta-lactam) with the amino group of L-threonine. It is a L-threonine derivative, a member of piperidones, a delta-lactam, a tertiary alcohol, a primary amino compound, a secondary alcohol and a dipeptide. It derives from a tabtoxinine-delta-lactam.
