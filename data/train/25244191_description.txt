The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of 3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a long-chain 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a 3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA.
