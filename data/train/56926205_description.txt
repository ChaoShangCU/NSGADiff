The molecule is a withanolide saponin that consists of 3-hydroxy-22,26-epoxyergosta-5,24-diene substituted by additonal hydroxy groups at positions 19 and 27, oxo groups at positions 1 and 26 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycodic linkage. It has been isolated from Physalis longifolia. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a withanolide saponin, a 19-hydroxy steroid, a 27-hydroxy steroid, a delta-lactone, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and an ergostanoid.
