The molecule is a quinone imine that is 1,4-benzoquinone imine substituted by a methoxy group at position 3 and a (phenylacetyl)nitrilo group attached to the nitrogen atom. Isolated from the fermentation broth of Penicillium minioluteum, it exhibits neurotrophic effect of NGF. It has a role as a nerve growth factor stimulator and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a hydrazone, a carbohydrazide and a quinone imine. It derives from a 1,4-benzoquinone imine.
