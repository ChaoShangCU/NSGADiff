The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose, alpha-D-mannopyranose and beta-D-mannopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->6) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-alpha-D-Manp and an alpha-D-Manp-(1->6)-beta-D-Manp.
