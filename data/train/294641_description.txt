The molecule is an L-alpha-amino acid that is L-alanine in which the methyl group is replaced by a (5S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-1,2-oxazol-5-yl group. A glutamine analogue antimetabolite, it interferes with glutamate metabolism and several glutamate-dependent synthetic enzymes. It is obtained as a fermentation product of Streptomyces sviceus bacteria. It has a role as an antimetabolite, a metabolite, an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-glutamyltransferase) inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent, an antileishmanial agent and a glutamine antagonist. It is a member of isoxazoles, an organochlorine compound and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid.
