The molecule is a L-cysteine derivative that is L-cysteine sulfoxide in which the hydrogen attached to sulfur is replaced by a 5-L-histidyl group. It has a role as a marine metabolite. It is a sulfoxide, a L-cysteine derivative, a L-histidine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It is a tautomer of a S-(5-histidyl)cysteine sulfoxide dizwitterion.
