The molecule is a triazaacenaphthylene that is 2,2a,3,4,5,5a,6,7-octahydro-1H-1,8,8b-triazaacenaphthylene which is substituted at positions 3, 4, and 7 by methyl, sulfooxy, and (2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-4-yl)(hydroxy)methyl groups, respectively (the 2aS,3R,4S,5aS,7R stereoisomer in which the carbon bearing the hydroxy group has R configuration). It is a cyanotoxin produced by several species of freshwater cyanobacteria, such as Aphanizomenon ovalisporum. It has a role as a cyanotoxin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, a hepatotoxic agent and a genotoxin. It is a member of cylindrospermopsins, a triazaacenaphthylene, an alkaloid, a pyrimidone, a secondary alcohol and an organic sulfate. It is a tautomer of a cylindrospermopsin zwitterion.
