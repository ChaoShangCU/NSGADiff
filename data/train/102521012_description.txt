The molecule is a 2-monoglyceride obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 11,12-epoxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-icosatrienoic acid with the 2-hydroxy group of glycerol. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a 2-monoglyceride, an epoxide and a polyunsaturated fatty ester. It derives from an 11,12-EET.
