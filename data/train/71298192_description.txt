The molecule is an aminotetrasaccharide that is beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-GalpNAc in which the non-terminal galatopyranosyl group has been glycosylated at position 2 by an alpha-L-fucopyranosyl group. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc.
