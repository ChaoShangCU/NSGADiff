The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate OH groups of 1-(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosyl)-5-[(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosylamino)methylideneamino]imidazole-4-carboxamide. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a 1-(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosyl)-5-[(5-phospho-beta-D-ribosylamino)methylideneamino]imidazole-4-carboxamide.
