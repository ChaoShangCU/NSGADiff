The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 1-methyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of (3-endo)-9-methyl-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-amine. A selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, it is used (generally as the monohydrochloride salt) to manage nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and to prevent and treat postoperative nausea and vomiting. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist and an antiemetic. It is a member of indazoles, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a tertiary amino compound.
