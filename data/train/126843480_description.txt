The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of hyodeoxycholic acid with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucuronic acid. It has a role as a human urinary metabolite. It is an O-acyl carbohydrate, a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid and a steroid glucosiduronic acid. It derives from a hyodeoxycholic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a hyodeoxycholic acid 24-O-(beta-D-glucuronide)(1-).
