The molecule is an aryl sulfate that is 4-nitrocatechol in which the hydroxy group that is meta to the nitro group has been converted into the corresponding hydrogen sulfate. It is used (commonly as its dipotassium salt) as a chromogenic substrate for sulphatase. It has a role as a chromogenic compound. It is a member of 4-nitrophenols and an aryl sulfate. It derives from a 4-nitrocatechol.
