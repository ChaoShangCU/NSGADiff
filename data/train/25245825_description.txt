The molecule is a germacrane sesquiterpenoid derived from germacrane by dehydrogenation between the 1-10, 4-5, and 11-13 positions, and by oxidation of the methyl group at position 12 to the corresponding carboxylic acid. It is a monocarboxylic acid and a germacrane sesquiterpenoid. It is a conjugate acid of a germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oate.
