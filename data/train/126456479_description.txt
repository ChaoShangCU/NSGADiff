The molecule is an O-acyl carbohydrate obtained by the formal condensation of the 20-carboxy group of 20-hydroxy-20-oxoleukotriene B4 with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucuronic acid. It is a leukotriene, a glucosiduronic acid, a dicarboxylic acid and an O-acyl carbohydrate. It derives from a 20-hydroxy-20-oxoleukotriene B4. It is a conjugate acid of a 20-hydroxy-20-oxoleukotriene B4-20-(beta-D-glucuronide)(2-).
