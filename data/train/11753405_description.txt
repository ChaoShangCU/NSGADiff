The molecule is a biflavonoid that consists of two units of 5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavanone attached at the C-3 position (the meso-isomer). Isolated from Stellera chamaejasme, it exhibits antimitotic and antifungal activity. It has a role as an antifungal agent, an antimitotic and a plant metabolite. It is a biflavonoid, a hydroxyflavanone, a ring assembly and a member of 4'-methoxyflavanones.
