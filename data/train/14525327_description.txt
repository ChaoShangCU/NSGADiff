The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is cucurbitadienol in which the side-chain double bond (position 24-25) has undergone formal oxidation to introduce hydroxy groups at positions 24 and 25 (the 24R stereoisomer). It is a biometabolite of mogrosides found in Siraitia grosvenorii. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid and a hydroxy seco-steroid. It derives from a cucurbitadienol.
