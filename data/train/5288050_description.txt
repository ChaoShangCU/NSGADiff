The molecule is a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-galactopyranose in which the galactose residue has beta-configuration at the anomeric centre. It is an oligosaccharide sulfate, a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-glucopyranose and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta(4)-GlcpA-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc and a 4-deoxy-Delta(4)-beta-D-GlcpA. It is a conjugate acid of a beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta(4)-GlcpA-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc6S(2-).
