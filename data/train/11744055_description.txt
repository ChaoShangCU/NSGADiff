The molecule is a quassinoid that is 13,20-epoxypicras-3-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 1, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 21 and oxo groups at positions 2 and 16. Isolated from the ethanol extract of the stem of Brucea mollis, it exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a quassinoid, a delta-lactone, an enone, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a heptol and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a hydride of a picrasane.
