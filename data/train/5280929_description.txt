The molecule is the intermediate in the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 from uroporphyrinogen III in which three methyl groups have been introduced at positions 2, 7 and 20 of the tetrapyrrole framework and in which the carboxymethyl group at position 2 has been oxidised to form a lactone ring. It is a conjugate acid of a precorrin-3B(7-) and a precorrin-3B(6-).
