The molecule is a para-terphenyl that consists of 1,4-diphenylbenzene substituted by acetyloxy groups at positions 3', 5' and 6', hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 4'' and a benzyloxy group at position 2'. It is isolated from the fruit body of the mushroom Paxillus curtisii and exhibits radical scavenging activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is a member of phenols, an acetate ester, a benzoate ester and a para-terphenyl. It derives from a hydride of a 1,4-diphenylbenzene.
