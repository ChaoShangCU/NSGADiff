The molecule is a tertiary alcohol that is protoasukamycin in which the 2,4-disubstituted phenol moiety has been oxidised to give the corresponding 2,4-disubstituted 4-hydroxycyclohexa-2,5-dienone. It is a precursor in the biosynthesis of asukamycin. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is an enamide, a polyketide, a tertiary alcohol, an enol, an enone, a cyclic ketone and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a protoasukamycin.
