The molecule is a docosanoid that is (14S)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid in which a cysteinyl group is attached at position 13R via a sulfide linkage. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a dicarboxylic acid, a docosanoid, an organic sulfide, a secondary alcohol and a S-substituted L-cysteine. It is a conjugate acid of a (13R)-S-cysteinyl-(14S)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoate(1-).
