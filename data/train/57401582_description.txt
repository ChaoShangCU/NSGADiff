The molecule is a triterpenoid that is decahydronaphthalene substituted by methyl groups at positions 1, 1, 4a and 6, hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 6 and a (6E,10E)-2,6,10-trimethyltrideca-2,6,10-trien-13-yl group at position 5. Isolated from resinous exudate of Pistacia lentiscus and Commiphora mukul, it exhibits cytotoxicity towards prostrate cancers. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid, a carbobicyclic compound and a diol.
