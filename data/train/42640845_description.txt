The molecule is a 19-membered cyclodepsipeptide that is isolated from the fermentation broth of marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola; it has been found to block tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of NFkappaB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cyclodepsipeptide and a macrocycle. It derives from a (3S,4S)-3-hydroxy-4-methyloctanoic acid.
