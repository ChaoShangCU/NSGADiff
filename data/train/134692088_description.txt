The molecule is a carbonate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the hydroxy group of 5-(undeca-3,5,7-trien-1-yl)furan-2-ol with one of the hydroxy groups of carbonic acid. A metabolite of the endophytic fungus Emericellasp. XL029. The configuration of the double bonds of the undecatrienyl group is not stated. It has a role as an antifungal agent and a fungal metabolite. It derives from a 5-(undeca-3,5,7-trien-1-yl)furan-2-ol.
