The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is (3beta,16alpha)-3,16-dihydroxy-12-oxooleanan-28-al attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a trisaccharide derivative, a triterpenoid saponin, a cyclic terpene ketone, an aldehyde and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
