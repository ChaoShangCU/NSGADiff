The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin (tricin) in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 5 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a dimethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, a polyphenol, a dihydroxyflavone and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin.
