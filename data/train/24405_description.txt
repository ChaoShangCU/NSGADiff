The molecule is a nucleoside analogue in which adenosine has been modified by substitution at the 6-amino nitrogen by a Delta(2)-isopentenyl group. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a plant growth regulator and a plant metabolite. It is a nucleoside analogue and a N-ribosyl-N(6)-isopentenyladenine. It derives from an adenosine.
