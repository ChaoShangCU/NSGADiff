The molecule is a disaccharide derivative consisting of two 3-deoxy-alpha-D-manno-oct-2-ulopyranonosyl units joined via an alpha-(2->8)-linkage with an O-allyl group at the anomeric centre and with the carboxy group of the residue at the non-reducing end methyl-esterified. It is a disaccharide derivative, a glycoside, a methyl ester and a dicarboxylic acid monoester. It is a conjugate acid of an alpha-Kdo1Me-(2->8)-alpha-Kdo-OAll(1-).
