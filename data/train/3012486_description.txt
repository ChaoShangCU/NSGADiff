The molecule is a trihydroxyflavanone that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5, 7 and 3', a methoxy group at position 4' and prenyl groups at positions 8 and 2'. Isolated from Dendrolobium lanceolatum, it exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a trihydroxyflavanone, a monomethoxyflavanone and a member of 4'-methoxyflavanones. It derives from a (2S)-flavanone.
