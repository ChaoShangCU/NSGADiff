The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2S)-2-{3-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-oxopyridin-1(2H)-yl}-3-cyclopropylpropanoic acid with the primary amino group of (2R,3S)-3-amino-N-benzyl-2-hydroxy-4-[(3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]butanamide. It is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. It has a role as an EC 3.4.22.69 (SARS coronavirus main proteinase) inhibitor, an antiviral agent and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones, a secondary carboxamide, a pyridone, a member of cyclopropanes and a tert-butyl ester.
