The molecule is a nucleotide-sugar oxoanion obtained by deprotonation of the diphosphate OH groups of dTDP-4-dehydro-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucose; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It derives from a dTDP-alpha-D-glucose(2-). It is a conjugate base of a dTDP-4-dehydro-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucose.
