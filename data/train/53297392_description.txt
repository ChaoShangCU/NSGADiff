The molecule is an anthracycline antibiotic that is aclacinomycin A in which the ketone function on the trisaccharide fragment has undergone 2,3-dehydrogenation to afford the corresponding enone. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent and a metabolite. It is an aminoglycoside, an anthracycline, a member of phenols, a polyketide, a tertiary alcohol, a trisaccharide derivative, an enone, a member of tetracenequinones and a methyl ester. It derives from an aklavinone. It is a conjugate base of an aclacinomycin Y(1+). It is a tautomer of an aclacinomycin Y zwitterion.
