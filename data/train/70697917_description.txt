The molecule is a member of the class of psoralens that is psoralen substituted by a methoxy group at position 4 and a [(2R)-3-butoxy-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl]oxy group at position 9. Isolated from the roots of Angelica dahurica, it exhibits inhibitory activity against COX-2 and 5-lipooxygenase. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor and a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. It is a member of psoralens, an aromatic ether and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a psoralen.
