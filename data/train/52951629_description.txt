The molecule is a homoflavonoid glycoside that is 5'-prenylophioglonol attached to 2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the whole plant of Ophioglossum pedunculosum and exhibits anti-HBV activity. It has a role as an anti-HBV agent and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a disaccharide derivative, a homoflavonoid glycoside and a hydroxy homoflavonoid. It derives from an ophioglonol.
