The molecule is a p-menthane monoterpenoid that is p-menth-2-ene substituted by a hydroperoxy group at position 1 and an acetyloxy group at position 8 (the 1R,4S stereoisomer). Isolated from the leaves of Laurus nobilis, it exhibits trypanocidal activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a trypanocidal drug. It is a p-menthane monoterpenoid, an acetate ester and a peroxol.
