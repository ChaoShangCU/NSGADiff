The molecule is a docosanoid that is (4Z,8E,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at the 7S- and 17S-positions. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid, a lipid hydroperoxide and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7S,17S)-bis(hydroperoxy)-(4Z,8E,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoate.
