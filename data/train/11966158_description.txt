The molecule is a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxydecanoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It derives from a decanoic acid and a (S)-3-hydroxydecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA(4-).
