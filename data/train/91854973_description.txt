The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide that is beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-alpha-D-GalpNAc in which the hydroxy group at position 3 of the alpha-D-GalpNAc moiety has been glycosylated by a beta-D-Galp group. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-[beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)]-alpha-D-GalpNAc.
