The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is myricetin 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside] in which the hydroxy group at position 6 of the beta-D-glucosyl group has been converted to the corresponding acetate. Identified in PMID: 23549747 Fig. S21 peak 4. It is an acetate ester and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a myricetin 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside]. It is a conjugate acid of a myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside](1-).
