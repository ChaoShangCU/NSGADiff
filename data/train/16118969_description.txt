The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is 19alpha-hydroxyasiatic acid attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 28 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the leaves of Rosa laevigata. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a tetrol. It derives from a 19alpha-hydroxyasiatic acid. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
