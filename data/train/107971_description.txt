The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is daidzein attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It is used in the treatment of alcohol dependency (antidipsotropic). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a hydroxyisoflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a 7-hydroxyisoflavones 7-O-beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a daidzein.
