The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide comprised of an L-iduronic acid residue, sulfated on O-2, a glucuronic acid residue, and two N-acetylated galactosamine residues, one of which is at the reducing end and both of which are sulfated on O-4. It is an intermediate in the chondroitin sulfate degradation pathway. It has a role as a mouse metabolite.
