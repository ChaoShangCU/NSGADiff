The molecule is a sulfonamide that is N-phenylmethanesulfonamide in which the phenyl group is sustituted at position 4 by a 1-hydroxy-2-(isopropylamino)ethyl group. It has both beta-adrenoreceptor blocking (Vaughan Williams Class II) and cardiac action potential duration prolongation (Vaughan Williams Class III) antiarrhythmic properties. It is used (usually as the hydrochloride salt) for the management of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of ethanolamines, a secondary amino compound, a secondary alcohol and a sulfonamide. It is a conjugate base of a sotalol(1+).
