The molecule is a pyranoindole that is notoamide S in which the phenolic hydrosy group at position 6 of the indole moiety has formal addition to the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group at postion 7 of the indole moiety to give the corresponding 7,7-dimethyl-1,7-dihydropyrano[2,3-g]indole derivative. Isolated from a mussel-derived Aspergillus species. It has a role as a mycotoxin. It is a dipeptide, a pyrrolopyrazine, a notoamide and a pyranoindole. It derives from a notoamide S.
