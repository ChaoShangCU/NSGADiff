The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z,29Z)-dotriacontapentaenoyl-CoA. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), a very long-chain acyl-CoA(4-) and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z,29Z)-dotriacontapentaenoyl-CoA.
