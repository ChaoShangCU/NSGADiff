The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (5Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (5Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoyl-CoA(4-).
