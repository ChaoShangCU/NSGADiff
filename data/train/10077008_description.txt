The molecule is a para-terphenyl that consists of 1,4-diphenylbenzene substituted by acetyloxy groups at positions 3', 5' and 6', hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 4'' and a (3-phenylpropanoyl)oxy group at position 2'. It is isolated from the fruit body of the mushroom Paxillus curtisii and exhibits radical scavenging activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is an acetate ester, a 3-phenylpropionate ester, a member of phenols and a para-terphenyl. It derives from a hydride of a 1,4-diphenylbenzene.
