The molecule is an oxo fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxylic acid group of (15Z)-12-oxophyto-10,15-dienoic acid. It is an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (15Z)-12-oxophyto-10,15-dienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (15Z)-12-oxophyto-10,15-dienoyl-CoA(4-).
