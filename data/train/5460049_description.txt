The molecule is a hexuronic acid that results from hydrolytic ring cleavage of the hemiacetal group of 4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronic acid with subsequent tautomerisation of the resulting enol to the corresponding ketone. It is a hexuronic acid and an aldehyde. It is a conjugate acid of a 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate.
