The molecule is a flavonoid oxoanion resulting from the deprotonation of the hydroxy groups at positions 5 and 7 of the flavonoid ring of myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-trans-4-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside]. Identified in Fig. S21 peak 2 of PMID:29967287. It is a conjugate base of a myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-trans-4-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside].
