The molecule is a carbamate ester that is the mono-N-isopropyl derivative of meprobamate (which is a significant metabolite). Carisoprodol interrupts neuronal communication within the reticular formation and spinal cord, resulting in sedation and alteration in pain perception. It is used as a muscle relaxant in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions associated with painful muscle spasm. It has a role as a muscle relaxant.
