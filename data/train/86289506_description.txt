The molecule is a member of the class of tetracenomycins that is 8-demethyltetracenomycin C in which the hydroxyl hydrogen at position 8 is replaced by a 2-O-methyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyl residue. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a monosaccharide derivative, an enol ether, an enone, a member of phenols, a member of tetracenequinones, a tetracenomycin, a methyl ester and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a tetracenomycin C.
