The molecule is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of isopentadecanoic acid. It is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an isopentadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an isopentadecanoyl-CoA(4-).
