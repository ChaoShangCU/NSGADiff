The molecule is a flavone C-glycoside that is luteolin in which the hydrogen at position 2 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-arabinosyl residue. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a disaccharide derivative, a tetrahydroxyflavone, a polyphenol and a flavone C-glycoside. It derives from a luteolin.
