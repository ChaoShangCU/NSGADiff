The molecule is an organic heterotetracyclic that is 1,2,3,4a,5,6,6a,12,12a,12b-decahydropyrano[3,2-a]xanthene-8,11-dione substituted by a 2-hydroxypropan-2-yl group at position 3, hydroxy group at position 12, methyl groups at positions 6a and 12b and a 3-(acetyloxy)-4-methylhexan-2-yl moiety at position 9. Isolated from the fermentation broth of Stachybotrys bisbyi SANK 17777, it acts as an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 2.3.1.26 (sterol O-acyltransferase) inhibitor. It is an organic heterotetracyclic compound, an acetate ester, a cyclic ether, a secondary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol and a member of p-quinones.
