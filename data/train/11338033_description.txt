The molecule is a member of the class of pryrazoles that is 4-amino-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid in which the primary amino group has been acylated by a 2,6-dichlorobenzoyl group and in which the carboxylic acid has been converted into a carboxamide by formal condensation with the primary amino group of 4-aminopiperidine. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a secondary carboxamide, a member of pyrazoles, a dichlorobenzene and a member of piperidines.
