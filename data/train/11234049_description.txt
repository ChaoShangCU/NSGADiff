The molecule is a member of the class of pyridines that is pyridine which is substituted by a 2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl group at position 2 and by a 2-fluoro-4-[(5R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-oxo-1,3-oxazolidin-3-yl]phenyl group at position 5. It is used as its phosphate pro-drug used for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by certain susceptible bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible strains), various Streptococcus species, and Enterococcus faecalis. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, a drug metabolite and a protein synthesis inhibitor. It is a member of pyridines, a member of tetrazoles, an organofluorine compound, an oxazolidinone, a primary alcohol and a carbamate ester.
