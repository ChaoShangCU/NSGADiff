The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 11-oxo-ETE. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and an enone. It derives from an 11-oxo-ETE. It is a conjugate acid of an 11-oxo-ETE-CoA(4-).
