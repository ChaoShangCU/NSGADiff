The molecule is an acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid. It derives from a 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oyl-CoA(4-).
