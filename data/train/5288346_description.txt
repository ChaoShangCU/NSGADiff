The molecule is a serine derivative that is L-serine having a 3-O-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl moiety attached to the side-chain oxygen. It is an O-glycosyl-L-serine and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It is a tautomer of an O-(3-O-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl)-L-serine zwitterion.
