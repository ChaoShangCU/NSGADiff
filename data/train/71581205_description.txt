The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z)-hexacosapentaenoyl-CoA. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an (11Z)-Delta(11)-fatty acyl-CoA(4-), a very long-chain acyl-CoA(4-) and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of an (11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z)-hexacosapentaenoyl-CoA.
