The molecule is a racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (+)-GR24 and (-)-GR24. It has been found to inhibit lateral shoot branching (see Nature 2008, v455, 189), stimulate germination of Striga (witchweeds), and aid in the symbiosis of over 80% of terrestrial plants with fungi at arbuscular mycorrihizae in roots. It contains a (+)-GR24 and a (-)-GR24.
