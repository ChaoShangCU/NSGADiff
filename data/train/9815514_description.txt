The molecule is an N-alkylpyrrolidine that is nicotine in which the methylene hydrogens at position 2 on the pyrrolidine ring have been replaced by an oxo group and the pyridine nitrogen converted into the corresponding N-oxide. A minor metabolite of nicotine. It has a role as a drug metabolite, a human urinary metabolite, a rat metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a N-alkylpyrrolidine, a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones and a member of pyridine N-oxides. It derives from a nicotine.
