The molecule is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride that results from the formal condensation of the phosphoryl group of AMP with the carboxyl group of 2-amino-3-hydroxy-4-methylbenzoic acid. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It derives from an adenosine 5'-monophosphate and a 3-hydroxy-4-methylanthranilic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-amino-3-hydroxy-4-methylbenzoyl-AMP(1-).
