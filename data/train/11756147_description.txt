The molecule is an organic heterotetracyclic compound that is 4,4,6a,12b-tetramethyl-11-oxo-1,3,4,4a,5,6,6a,12,12a,12b-decahydro-2H,11H-benzo[f]pyrano[4,3-b]chromen-3-yl acetate substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 4a and 12a and by a 4-methoxyphenyl group at position 9 (the 3R,4aR,6aR,12aS,12bS steroisomer). Isolated from the culture broth of Penicillium, it acts as a selective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent and a Penicillium metabolite. It is an organic heterotetracyclic compound, an aromatic ether, a tertiary alcohol, a cyclic ketone, a delta-lactone and an acetate ester.
