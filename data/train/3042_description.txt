The molecule is the ester resulting from the formal condensation of 1-cyclohexylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid with 2-(diethylamino)ethanol. An anticholinergic, it is used as the hydrochloride to treat or prevent spasm in the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly that associated with irritable bowel syndrome. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist, an antispasmodic drug and a parasympatholytic. It is a tertiary amine and a carboxylic ester. It derives from a 2-diethylaminoethanol and a 1,1'-bi(cyclohexyl)-1-carboxylic acid.
