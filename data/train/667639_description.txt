The molecule is a stilbenol that is trans-stilbene in which one of the phenyl groups is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4, while the other phenyl group is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 5. It has a role as a protein kinase inhibitor, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, a plant metabolite, a hypoglycemic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a stilbenol, a member of resorcinols, a member of catechols and a polyphenol. It derives from a hydride of a trans-stilbene.
