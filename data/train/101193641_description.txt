The molecule is a dihydroxyflavone that is tricin 4'-O-(erythro-beta-guaiacylglyceryl) ether in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 7 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a dimethoxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monohydroxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a polyphenol. It derives from a 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin and a (-)-(7R,8S)-guaiacylglycerol.
