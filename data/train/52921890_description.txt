The molecule is a resolvin that is (6Z,8E,10E,14Z,16E)-icosa-6,8,10,14,16-pentaenoic acid which is substituted at positions 5, 12 and 18 by hydroxy groups (the 5S,12R,18S stereoisomer). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a resolvin, a secondary allylic alcohol, a triol and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (18S)-resolvin E1(1-).
