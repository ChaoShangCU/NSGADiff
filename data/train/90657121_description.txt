The molecule is a lactol that is (-)-noscapine [which is also known as (-)-alpha-narcotine] in which the carbonyl group of the lactone moiety has been reduced to give the corresponding lactol. It is the biosynthetic precursor of (-)-noscapine. It is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, a cyclic acetal, a lactol, a tertiary amino compound, an organic heterotricyclic compound, an organic heterobicyclic compound, an aromatic ether and a member of 2-benzofurans.
