The molecule is a spirostanyl glycoside that is sarsasapogenin in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 3 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->3)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety. It is isolated from Asparagus officinalis. It has a role as a mouse metabolite, a rat metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative, a spirostanyl glycoside and a cyclic ketal. It derives from a (25S)-5beta-spirostan-3beta-ol.
