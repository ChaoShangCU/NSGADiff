The molecule is a linear amino hexasaccharide comprising beta-D-glucose at the reducing end with at the 4-position a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galactosyl moiety, alpha(2->3)-sialylated at the terminal galactosyl residue. It has a role as an antigen and an epitope. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
