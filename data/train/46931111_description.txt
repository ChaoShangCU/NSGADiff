The molecule is an organosulfate oxoanion resulting from the removal of a proton from both the carboxy group and the sulfate group of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-galactopyranose arising from deprotonation of carboxy and sulfate groups; major species at pH 7.3. It is an organosulfate oxoanion, a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and a monocarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-glucopyranose.
