The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-12-ene substituted by an alpha-hydroxy group at position 3, an alpha-methoxy group at position 11 and a carboxy group at position 28. Isolated from the leaves and twigs of Fatsia polycarpa, it exhibits antibacterial and anti-HBV activities. It has a role as a metabolite, an anti-HBV agent, an antibacterial agent and a plant metabolite. It is a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, an ether and a pentacyclic triterpenoid.
