The molecule is any one of a group of prenol derivatives made up of varying numbers of cis-linked isoprene units, terminating in an alpha-saturated isoprenoid group containing an alcohol functional group, with the three isoprene units at the distal end trans-linked. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is an isoprenoid and a polyprenol.
