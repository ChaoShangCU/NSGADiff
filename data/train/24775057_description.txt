The molecule is an abietane diterpenoid that is ent-abieta-2(3),13(15)-diene-16,12-olide substituted by a 1beta-acetoxy group and a beta-epoxy group across positions 8 and 14. Isolated from the leaves of Gelonium aequoreum, it exhibits moderate cytotoxicity against lung (A549), breast (MDAMB-231 and MCF7), and liver (HepG2) cancer cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an abietane diterpenoid, an acetate ester, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, an epoxide and a gamma-lactone.
