The molecule is an echinocandin initially isolated as a very minor bioactive fermentation product of Glarea lozoyensis (originally known as Zalerion arboricola). Subsequent random mutagenesis work and optimisation of the fermentation medium permitted the industrial production of pneumocandin B0, which is used as the starting point for the synthesis of the antifungal drug caspofungin. It has a role as an antifungal agent and a fungal metabolite. It is an echinocandin and a homodetic cyclic peptide.
