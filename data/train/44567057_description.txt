The molecule is a biflavonoid obtained by coupling of 8,3'-dihydroxy-7,4',5'-trimethoxyflavan and 8-hydroxy-7,3',4',5'-tetramethoxyflavan resulting in a bond between C-5 positions of the two chromene rings. Isolated from Muntingia calabura, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a biflavonoid, a hydroxyflavan, a polyphenol, a methoxyflavan and a ring assembly.
