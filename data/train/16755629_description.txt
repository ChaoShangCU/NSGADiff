The molecule is an N-acylpyrrolidine resulting from the formal condensation of the pyrrolidine nitrogen of (2R,3S)-2-[(2S)-(2-carboxy)isobutyl-3-(methylsulfonylamino)pyrrolidine with the carboxylic acid group of 2-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-oxazole-4-carboxylic acid. It is a N-acylpyrrolidine, a N-alkylpyrrolidine, a member of 1,3-oxazoles and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a butyric acid.
