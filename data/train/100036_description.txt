The molecule is an organic heterotetracyclic compound that is 1,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone which is substituted at position 2 and 3 by 3-amino-1-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl and carboxymethyl groups, respectively, in which the hydroxy group beta- to the carboxamide has undergone formal condensation with the carboxy group to give the corresponding delta-lactone. Isolated from various strains of Kitasatospora aureofaciens (Streptomyces aureofaciens), it inhibits the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in vitro. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an anthraquinone, a delta-lactone, a primary carboxamide, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a member of phenols.
