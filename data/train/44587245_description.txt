The molecule is a steroid alkaloid that is 5alpha-pregnane substituted by a N-methylamino group at position 20 and a beta-N-methylbenzamido group at position 3. Isolated from Sarcococca hookeriana, it exhibits antiplasmodial activity and inhibitory activity against cholinesterase. It has a role as a metabolite, an antiplasmodial drug and an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor. It is a steroid alkaloid and a member of benzamides. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-pregnane.
