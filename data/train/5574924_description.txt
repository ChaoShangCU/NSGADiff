The molecule is an organic heterotetracyclic compound and guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone that is acrylic acid which is substituted at position 2 by a 4-hydroxy-3,8-dimethyl-1,3a,4,5,6,7-hexahydroazulen-5-yl group in which the double bond in the 7-membered ring has been epoxidised and in which the hydroxy group and the carboxy group have undergone formal condensation to give the corresponding gamma-lactone. It is found in Artemisia glabella. Arglabin-DMA HCl, the hydrochloride salt of the adduct resulting from the conjugate addition of dimethylamine to the ene-lactone moiety, has been successfully used in Khazakhstan for the treatment of breast, colon, ovarian and lung cancers. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a metabolite. It is an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a gamma-lactone, an epoxide and a sesquiterpene lactone.
