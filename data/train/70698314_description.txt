The molecule is a branched amino octasaccharide comprised of a sequence of alpha-D-mannose, beta-D-mannose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues linked (1->3), (1->4) and (1->4), to the beta-D-mannose of which is (1->6)-linked a tetrasaccharide branch comprising N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminose, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and alpha-D-mannose residues linked sequentially (2->6), (1->4) and (1->2). It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino octasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
