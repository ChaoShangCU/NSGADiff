The molecule is a cyclic adenyl ribonucleotide that is cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-phosphate) in which the hydrogen at position 8 has been replaced by a piperidin-1-yl group. A selective cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activator and cAMP analogue with high selectivity for site A of PKA type I and for site B of PKA type II. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a protein kinase A agonist. It is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide, an adenyl ribonucleotide, a tertiary amino compound and a member of piperidines. It derives from a 3',5'-cyclic AMP.
