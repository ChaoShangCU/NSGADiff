The molecule is a 20-oxo steroid that is 17alpha-pregn-5-en-20-one substituted by a benzoyloxy group at position 12 and hydroxy groups at positions 3, 14 and 17 (the 3beta,12beta,14beta stereoisomer). It is isolated from the roots of Calotropis gigantea and displays inhibitory effects towards chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 and human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a 17beta-hydroxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, a 14beta-hydroxy steroid, a benzoate ester, a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane.
