The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide consisting of alpha-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-alpha-D-mannose having a alpha-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-alpha-D-glucosyl group attached at the 4'-position (on the galactosaminyl residue). It is an amino hexasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
