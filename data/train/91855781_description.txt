The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of beta-D-galactopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranose and alpha-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) glycosidic linkages. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc.
