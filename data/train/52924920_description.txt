The molecule is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine in which the 1- and 2-acyl groups are specified as hexadecanoyl (palmitoyl) and (8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoyl respectively. It derives from a hexadecanoic acid and an all-cis-icosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid. It is a tautomer of a 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(8Z,11Z,14Z-icosatrienoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion.
