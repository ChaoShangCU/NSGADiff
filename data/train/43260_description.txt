The molecule is an aromatic ether that is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene which is substituted at position 2 by a 2-amino-1-hydroxyethyl group. The immediate and active metabolite of midrodine, it is a direct-acting sympathomimetic with selective alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. Midrodine is used (generally as its hydrochloride salt) as a prodrug for deglymidodrine, which acts as a peripheral vasoconstrictor in the treatment of certain hypotensive states. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent and a vasoconstrictor agent. It is an aromatic ether, a secondary alcohol and a primary amino compound.
