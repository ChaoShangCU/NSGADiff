The molecule is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid anion that is the conjugate base of 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid, arising from deprotonation of the carboxy group. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid anion, an oxo fatty acid anion and a branched-chain fatty acid anion. It derives from a butyrate. It is a conjugate base of a 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid.
