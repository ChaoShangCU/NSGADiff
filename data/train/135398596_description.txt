The molecule is a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate(2-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate OH groups of 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate (dGMP). It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphate(2-) and a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-phosphate(2-). It is a conjugate base of a 2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate.
