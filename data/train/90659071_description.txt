The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (5Z)-tetradecenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It derives from a (7Z)-3-oxohexadecenoyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (5Z)-tetradecenoyl-CoA.
