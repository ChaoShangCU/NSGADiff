The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that consists of a heterotetracyclic system linked to a pyridine moiety. Isolated from the fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus, it exhibits inhibitory activity against acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2. It has a role as an acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 inhibitor and an Aspergillus metabolite. It is an acetate ester, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a member of pyridines and a sesquiterpenoid.
