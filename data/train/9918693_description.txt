The molecule is a ginsenoside found in Panax ginseng and Panax japonicus var. major that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent, a plant metabolite and an angiogenesis modulating agent. It is a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid and a glycoside. It derives from a (20S)-protopanaxadiol. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
