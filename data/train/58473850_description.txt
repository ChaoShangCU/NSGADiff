The molecule is a cyclic ketone that is the naturally occurring (4S,5R) enantiomer of the cis-isomer of isohumolone, produced during the brewing process due to thermal isomerism, which converts humulones to isohumulones via an acyloin-type ring contraction. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an enol, an enone, a tertiary alcohol, a cyclic ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
