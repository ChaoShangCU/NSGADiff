The molecule is a fatty amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of oleic acid with the amino group of L-glutamic acid. It is a N-acyl-L-glutamic acid and a N-(fatty acyl)-L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from an oleic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-oleoyl-L-glutamate(2-).
