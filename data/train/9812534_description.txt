The molecule is a didemnin that is didemin B in which the hydroxy group of the 1-(2-hydroxypropanoyl)-L-prolinamide moiety has been oxidised to the corresponding ketone. It was originally isolated from the Mediterranean tunicate Aplidium albicans. It has a role as a marine metabolite and an antineoplastic agent.
