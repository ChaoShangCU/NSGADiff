The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is urs-12-en-28-oic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3, 6 and 24 (the 3alpha,6alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from Salvia santolinifolia, it exhibits inhibitory activity against cholinesterase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor. It is a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a triol. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
