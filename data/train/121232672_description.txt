The molecule is an N-acyl-L-alanine resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of L-alanine with the carboxy group of (12S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoic acid. It has a role as a mammalian metabolite. It is a N-acyl-L-alanine, a lipid hydroperoxide and a N-(fatty acyl)-L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a 12(S)-HPETE. It is a conjugate acid of a N-[(12S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoyl]alaninate.
