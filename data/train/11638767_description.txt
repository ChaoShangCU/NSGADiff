The molecule is an EpDPE obtained by formal epoxidation across the 10,11-double bond of all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (4Z,7Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-10,11-epoxydocosapentaenoate.
