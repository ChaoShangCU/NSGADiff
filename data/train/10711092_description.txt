The molecule is an amino cyclitol glycoside that is 4alpha,6alpha-diaminocyclohexane-1beta,2alpha,3beta-triol (2-deoxystreptamine) in which the pro-R hydroxy group is substituted by an alpha-D-glucosyl residue. It derives from a 2-deoxystreptamine. It is a conjugate base of a 2'-deamino-2'-hydroxyparomamine(2+).
