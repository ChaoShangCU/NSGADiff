The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide consisting of a linear pentasaccharide chain of alpha-sialyl, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose and D-glucose residues linked sequentially (2->6), (1->3), (1->3) and (1->4), to the galactose residue nearest to the reducing end is also linked (1->6) a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl disaccharide unit. It is an amino heptasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
