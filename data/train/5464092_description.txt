The molecule is a hydrochloride resulting from the formal reaction of equimolar amounts of naloxone and hydrogen chloride. A specific opioid antagonist, it is used to reverse the effects of opioids, both following their use of opioids during surgery and in cases of known or suspected opioid overdose. It has a role as an antidote to opioid poisoning, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist and a central nervous system depressant. It contains a naloxone(1+).
