The molecule is an enoate ester obtained by formal condensation of the hydroxy function of (1R,2S,3S,4S)-4-formyl-2-methoxy-3-[(2E)-6-methylhept-2-en-2-yl]cyclohexanol with the carboxy group of 4-methoxycinnamic acid. It has a role as an angiogenesis inhibitor. It is an enoate ester and an aldehyde. It derives from a fumagalone, a (1S,2S,3S)-3-methoxy-2-[(2E)-6-methylhept-2-en-2-yl]-4-oxocyclohexanecarbaldehyde and a 4-methoxycinnamic acid.
