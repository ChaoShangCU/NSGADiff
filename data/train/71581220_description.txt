The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z)-tetracosatetraenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), a very long-chain acyl-CoA(4-) and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z)-tetracosatetraenoyl-CoA.
