The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid diamide obtained by formal condensation of the two carboxy groups of 2-chlorophthalic acid with the amino groups of 4-(1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropan-2-yl)-2-methylaniline and 2-amino-2-methylpropanenitrile. It has a role as an insecticide and an agrochemical. It is a dicarboxylic acid diamide, an aromatic amide, an organofluorine compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a nitrile. It derives from a phthalic acid.
