The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acid anion resulting from the removal of a proton from the carboxy group of (9Z,13S,15Z)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acid anion and a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion. It derives from a 9,11,15-octadecatrienoate. It is a conjugate base of a (9Z,13S,15Z)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoic acid.
