The molecule is a xanthene dye that is fluorescein bearing bromine substituents at positions 2', 4', 5' and 7' (on the xanthene ring) and iodine substituents at position 2, 3, 4, and 5 (on the phenyl ring). The dipotassium salt is the biological stain 'rose bengal'. It has a role as a fluorochrome. It is a member of benzoic acids, a tetrachlorobenzene, a xanthene dye, a member of phenols and an organoiodine compound. It derives from a fluorescin. It is a conjugate acid of a rose bengal(2-).
