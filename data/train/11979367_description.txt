The molecule is an anthocyanin cation that is pelargonidin in which the hydroxy group at position 3 is substituted by a 6-O-[(2E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl group and the hydroxy group at position 5 is substituted by a 4,6-bis-O-(carboxyacetyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It derives from a pelargonidin.
