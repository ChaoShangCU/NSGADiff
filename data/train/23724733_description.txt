The molecule is an anthocyanidin glycoside that is the cinnamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of 6''-hydroxy group of pelargonidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside with trans-4-coumaric acid. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an anthocyanidin glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid and a pelargonidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside.
