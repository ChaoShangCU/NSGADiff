The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is oleana-9(11),12-diene substituted by an alpha-hydroxy group at position 3 and a carboxy group at position 28. Isolated from the leaves and twigs of Fatsia polycarpa, it exhibits anti-HBV activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an anti-HBV agent and a plant metabolite. It is a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
