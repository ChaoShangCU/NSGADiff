The molecule is an indolyl carboxylate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of indole-3-carboxylic acid with the hydroxy group of tropine. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist, an antiemetic, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, a trypanocidal drug, an immunomodulator, a neuroprotective agent, an apoptosis inhibitor and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is an indolyl carboxylate ester, an azabicycloalkane and a tertiary amino compound. It derives from an indole-3-carboxylic acid and a tropine. It is a conjugate base of a tropisetron(1+).
