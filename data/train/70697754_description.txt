The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is urs-12-en-28-oic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2, 3 and 5 (the 2alpha,3beta stereoisomer). Isolated from Salvia santolinifolia, it exhibits inhibitory activity against cholinesterase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor. It is a triol, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
