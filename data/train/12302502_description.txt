The molecule is an oxoaporphine alkaloid that is 7H-dibenzo[de,g]quinolin-7-one which is substituted by methylenedioxy grups at the 1,2 and 9,10 positions. Compared with liriodenine, which lacks the 9,10-methylenedioxy group, cassameridine displays only moderate antifungal activity. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an organic heterohexacyclic compound, a cyclic acetal, a cyclic ketone, an organonitrogen heterocyclic compound and an oxoaporphine alkaloid.
