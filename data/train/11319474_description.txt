The molecule is a homodetic cyclic peptide composed of glycyl, L-phenylalanyl, L-tyrosyl, L-prolyl and L-phenylalanyl residues joined sequentially to give a 15-membered macrocycle. Isolated from Dianthus superbus var longicalycinus, it exhibits anti-cancer activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide and a macrocycle.
