The molecule is a dimeric branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of 6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, having a further 6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl moiety attached at the 6-position of the galactosamine. It is an oligosaccharide sulfate and an amino tetrasaccharide. It is a conjugate acid of a 6-O-sulfonato-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-[6-O-sulfonato-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->6)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine(2-).
