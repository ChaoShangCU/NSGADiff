The molecule is an indole alkaloid having a ajmalan-type skeleton and characterised by a 17alpha-acetoxy group, a 21beta-methyl group, loss of the 1-methyl group with associated unsaturation at N(1)=C(2), and a 20alpha-hydroxymethyl group in place of the 20beta-ethyl side-chain. It derives from a hydride of an ajmalan.
