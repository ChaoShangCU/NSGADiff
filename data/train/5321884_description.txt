The molecule is a stilbenoid that is trans-stilbene which has been substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2, 3, 5, and 4', and in which the hydroxy group at positon 2 has then been converted to the corresponding the beta-D-glucoside. It has a role as an antioxidant, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent, a cardioprotective agent, a platelet aggregation inhibitor and an apoptosis inhibitor. It is a stilbenoid, a beta-D-glucoside and a member of resorcinols.
