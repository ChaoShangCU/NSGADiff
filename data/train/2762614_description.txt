The molecule is an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derived from 6-carboxyfluorescein. A fluorescent cell staining dye, it is cell permeable and covalently couples, via its succinimidyl group, to intracellular molecules, notably to intracellular lysine residues. It has a role as a fluorochrome. It derives from a fluorescein.
