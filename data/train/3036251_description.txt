The molecule is a 3beta-hydroxy steroid that is stigmastane substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3, 5 and 6 (the 3beta,5alpha,6beta stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the roots of Breynia fruticosa. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a triol, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a 5alpha-hydroxy steroid and a 6beta-hydroxy steroid. It derives from a hydride of a stigmastane.
