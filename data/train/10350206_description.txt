The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is the diester obtained by the global condensation of the hydroxy groups of (3beta)-3,27-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid with trans-4-coumaric acid and cis-4-coumaric acid respectively. It is isolated from the dried leaves of Ilex asprella and exhibits significant toxicity against KB (epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx) and RPMI-7951 (melanoma) cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a diester, a monocarboxylic acid and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a (3beta)-3,27-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid, a trans-4-coumaric acid and a cis-4-coumaric acid.
