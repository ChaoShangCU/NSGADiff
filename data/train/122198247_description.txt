The molecule is a docosanoid anion that is the conjugate base of (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,17S)-17-hydroperoxydocosapentaenoic acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a docosanoid anion, a hydroperoxy fatty acid anion and a long-chain fatty acid anion. It derives from a (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosapentaenoate. It is a conjugate base of a (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,17S)-17-hydroperoxydocosapentaenoic acid.
