The molecule is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate(2-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate OH groups of 1,2-di[(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)]-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a 1,2-di[(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphate.
