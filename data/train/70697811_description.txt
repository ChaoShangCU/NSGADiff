The molecule is a cardenolide glycoside that is strophanthidin attached to a 4,6-dideoxy-3-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-O-methyl-beta-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Crossosoma bigelovii, it exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cardenolide glycoside, a 19-oxo steroid, a 5beta-hydroxy steroid, a disaccharide derivative and a steroid aldehyde. It derives from a strophanthidin.
