The molecule is a lignan that consists of a 3,4-dimethyloxolane ring substituted by 4-hydroxyphenyl groups at positions 2 and 5 respectively (the 2S,3R,4S,5S-stereoisomer). Isolated from the roots of Krameria lappacea, it exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a NF-kappaB inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a lignan, a member of phenols and a member of oxolanes.
