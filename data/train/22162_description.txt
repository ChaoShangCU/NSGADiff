The molecule is the hydrochloride salt of cyclopentolate. It is used to produce mydriasis (excessive dilation of the pupil) and cycloplegia (paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye) for opthalmic diagnostic procedures. It acts more quickly than atropine and has a shorter duration of action. It has a role as a mydriatic agent, a parasympatholytic, a diagnostic agent and a muscarinic antagonist. It contains a cyclopentolate.
