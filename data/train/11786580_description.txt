The molecule is a carboxylic ester obtained by the formal condensation of the 4-carboxy group of (2R)-2-hydroxy-2-{(3R,5R)-2-oxo-5-[(1E,5Z,8Z)-tetradeca-1,5,8-trien-1-yl]tetrahydrofuran-3-yl}butanedioic acid with the hydroxy group of 3-carboxy-2,3-dideoxy-L-threo-pentaric acid. It is a fungal metabolite that acts as an inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferase type I(GGTase I) of pathogenic fungal species. It has a role as a metabolite, an antifungal agent and an EC 2.5.1.59 (protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I) inhibitor. It is a tetracarboxylic acid, a carboxylic ester and a butan-4-olide. It derives from a pentaric acid.
