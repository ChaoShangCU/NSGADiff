The molecule is a pyrrolizine alkaloid that is seneciphylline in which the hydroxy hydrogen has been replaced by an acetyl group and the tertiary amino function has been oxidised to the corresponding N-oxide. It has a role as a Jacobaea metabolite. It is an acetate ester, a macrocyclic lactone, an olefinic compound, an organic heterotricyclic compound, a pyrrolizine alkaloid and a tertiary amine oxide. It derives from a seneciphylline.
