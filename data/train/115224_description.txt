The molecule is a nitrile that is cyanamide in which the hydrogens are replaced by a 1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene group which in turn is substituted by a (6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl group at the ring nitrogen. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a neonicotinoid insectide. It is a member of thiazolidines, a nitrile and a monochloropyridine. It derives from a 2-chloropyridine and a cyanamide.
