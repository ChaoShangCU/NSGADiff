The molecule is poly-L-lysine (n > 40) in which 50-70% of the epsilon-amino groups are substituted with benzylpenicilloyl groups. It is used as a skin-testing reagent to detect immunoglobulin E antibodies in people with a history of penicillin allergy. It has a role as a diagnostic agent. It is a thiazolidinemonocarboxylic acid, a random copolymer, an amino acid amide and a polypeptide. It derives from a benzylpenicillin.
