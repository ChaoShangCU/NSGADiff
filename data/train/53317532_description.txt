The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 4',5,7-trihydroxy-3-methoxyflavone attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the whole plant of Lepisorus contortus. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a dihydroxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a kaempferol.
