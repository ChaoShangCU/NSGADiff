The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is 6,8-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-chromen-5-ol in which the hydrogen of one of the methyl groups at position 2 is replaced by a [(1R,2S)-1,2,3-trimethylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl]methyl group. It is isolated from an Okinawan sponge Spongia sp.SS-1037 and shows moderate cytotoxicity against L1210 murine leukemia and KB human epidermoid carcinoma cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a sesquiterpenoid, a member of chromenes, a member of phenols and an aromatic ether.
