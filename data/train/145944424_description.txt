The molecule is a linear pentasaccharide derivative consisting of four alpha-D-mannose residues and one beta-D-glucosamine residue, linked sequentially (1->2), (1->2), (1->6) and (1->4), with the glucosamine residue linked glycosidically to a 6-sulfanylhexyl group. It is a glycoside and a pentasaccharide derivative.
