The molecule is a hydroxamic acid that is (3S)-N-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylthiomorpholine-3-carboxamide in which the hydrogen attached to the thiomorpholine nitrogen has been replaced by a [4-(pyridin-4-yloxy)phenyl]sulfonyl group. It is a selective inhibitor with of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2, 3, 9, 13, and 14. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor and an EC 3.4.24.35 (gelatinase B) inhibitor. It is a hydroxamic acid, a member of thiomorpholines, a sulfonamide, an aromatic ether and a member of pyridines. It is a conjugate base of a prinomastat(1+).
