The molecule is an azaphilone that is 1H-isochromene-6,8(7H,8aH)-dione substituted by a prop-1-en-1-yl group at position 3, hydroxy groups at positions 1 and 8a, a methyl group at position 7 and a (2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoyl)oxy group at position 7. It has been isolated from Penicillium purpurogenum. It has a role as a Penicillium metabolite. It is an azaphilone, a member of isochromenes, a benzoate ester, an enone, a polyketide and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from an o-orsellinic acid.
