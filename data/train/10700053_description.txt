The molecule is a galactoglycerolipid that consists of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol having (7Z,10Z,13Z)-hexadecatrienoyl and (7Z,10Z)-hexadecadienoyl as the acyl groups and a beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue attached at position 3. It has been found in Daphnia pulex and exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as a Daphnia pulex metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-galactopyranosyl diglyceride.
