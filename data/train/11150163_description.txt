The molecule is a methyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)alaninate that is the more active R-enantiomer of metalaxyl. A systemic fungicide, it is active against phytopathogens of the order Peronosporales and is used to conrtrol Pythium in a number of vegetable crops. It has a role as an agrochemical. It is a methyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)alaninate, a D-alanine derivative, an acylamino acid fungicide and an anilide fungicide. It derives from a D-alanine. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-metalaxyl.
