The molecule is the (S,S,S)-stereoisomer of nicotianamine. It has a role as a chelator, an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It derives from a (S)-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S,S,S)-nicotianamine monoanion. It is an enantiomer of a (R,R,R)-nicotianamine. It is a tautomer of a (S,S,S)-nicotianamine trizwitterion.
