The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol attached to a alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkages. Isolated from the aerial parts of Vicia faba and Lotus edulis, it exhibits inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I and II. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor, an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, an alpha-L-rhamnoside, an alpha-L-arabinopyranoside and a dihydroxyflavone. It derives from a kaempferol.
