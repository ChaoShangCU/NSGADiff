The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z)-hexacosahexaenoyl-CoA. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an (11Z)-Delta(11)-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a very long-chain acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of an (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z)-hexacosahexaenoyl-CoA.
