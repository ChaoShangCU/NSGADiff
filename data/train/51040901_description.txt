The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is maslinic acid attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 28 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the methanolic extract of the leaves of Symplocos lancifolia, it exhibits antibacterial activity. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a maslinic acid.
