The molecule is an N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid) with the amino group of ethanolamine. It is a N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine and a N-(saturated fatty acyl)ethanolamine. It derives from a tetradecanoic acid.
