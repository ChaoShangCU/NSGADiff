The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl, beta-D-galactopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl, beta-D-galactopyranosyl and D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3), (1->3), (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc.
