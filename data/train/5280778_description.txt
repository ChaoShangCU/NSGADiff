The molecule is an icosatetraenoic acid in which the double bonds are located at the 6-7, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15 positions and have E, Z, Z, and Z geometry, respectively, and in which the pro-S hydrogen is substituted by a hydroperoxy group. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from an icosa-6,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 5(S)-HPETE(1-).
