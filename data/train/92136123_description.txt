The molecule is a nucleotide-sugar oxoanion obtained by deprotonation of the diphosphate OH groups of dTDP-(2R,6S)-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-3(6H)-one; major species at pH 7.3. It derives from a dTDP-alpha-D-glucose(2-). It is a conjugate base of a dTDP-2,3-dehydro-2,6-dideoxy-4-keto-alpha-D-glucose.
