The molecule is an L-threonine derivative in which L-threonine is linked via its nitrogen to C-6 of the non-reducing-end galactose residue of 3-O-acetyl-alpha-D-galacto-hexodialdo-1,5-pyranosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactosamine; an important threonine-containing epitope of the Proteus penneri O-specific polysaccharide. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino disaccharide and a L-threonine derivative.
