The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA(4-).
