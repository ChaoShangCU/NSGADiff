The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,5E)-tetradecadienoic acid. It has a role as a rat metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,5E)-tetradecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
