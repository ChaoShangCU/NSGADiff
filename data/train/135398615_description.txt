The molecule is a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate(4-) that is the tetraanion of 2'-deoxyinosine 5'-triphosphate(dITP), arising from deprotonation of the four free OH groups of the triphosphate; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a dITP.
