The molecule is a viscumneoside that is viscumneoside IV in which the hydroxy group at position 2 of the glucosyl moiety has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-apifuranoside derivative. Found in Viscum coloratum, an evergreen hemiparasitic plant whose stems and leaves are used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatism. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a viscumneoside, a glycosyloxyflavone, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, a tertiary alcohol and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a viscumneoside IV, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, a beta-D-apiose and a rhamnacene.
