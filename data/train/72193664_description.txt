The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is tricin substituted at positions 4 and 7 by beta-glucosyl 6-O-sinapoylglucosyl residues respectively. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a cinnamate ester, a monohydroxyflavone, a dimethoxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a trans-sinapic acid and a 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin.
