The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol attached to a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1->2)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkages. Isolated from the aerial parts of Vicia faba and Lotus edulis, it exhibits inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a beta-D-galactoside, a dihydroxyflavone and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a kaempferol.
