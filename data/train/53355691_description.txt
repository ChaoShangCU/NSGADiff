The molecule is a steroid saponin that is 4-methylergosta-7,24(28)-dien-21-oic acid attached to an acetyloxy group at position 2, and a alpha-L-quinovopyranosyloxy group at position 3 (the 2alpha,3beta,4alpha,5alpha stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the roots of Breynia fruticosa. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a steroid acid, a steroid saponin, a steroid ester, a deoxyglucose derivative, a monosaccharide derivative, an acetate ester and a monocarboxylic acid.
