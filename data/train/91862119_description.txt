The molecule is a trisaccharide consisting of two beta-D-galactopyranose residues and a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residue joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc and a beta-(1->3)-galactobiose.
