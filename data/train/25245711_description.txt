The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) that is the tetraanion of octanoyl-CoA, arising from deprotonation of phosphate and diphosphate functions. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of an octanoyl-CoA.
