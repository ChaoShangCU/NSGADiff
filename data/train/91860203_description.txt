The molecule is a glycosyl alditol derivative consisting of D-mannopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminitol residues joined in sequence by (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is a glycosyl alditol derivative, a member of acetamides, a glycoside and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a N-acetyl-D-glucosaminitol.
