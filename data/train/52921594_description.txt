The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide comprising an alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl residue (2->3)-linked to a beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue which is itself linked at position 4 to a beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->3)-2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranosyl group. It is a galactosamine oligosaccharide and an amino tetrasaccharide.
