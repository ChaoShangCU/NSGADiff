The molecule is an anthrafuran and meroterpenoid that is 2,3,11,11a-tetrahydroanthra[2,3-b]furan which is substituted by a 2-oxopropylidene group at position 2, a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group at position 5, an oxo group at position 11, and hydroxy groups at positions 3a, 7, 9, and 10. It is one of the 'cryptic' secondary metabolites (i.e. expressed at very low levels in the absence of specific triggers and/or conditions) of Aspergillus fumogatus, obtained following the induction of the fungus with the actinomycete Streptomyces rapamycinicus. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a polyphenol, a meroterpenoid, an anthrafuran, an enone, a tertiary alcohol and an aromatic ketone.
