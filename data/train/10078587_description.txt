The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is 24,25-epoxy-13,30-cyclodammarane-3,7,23-triol esterified to the corresponding acetate at position 3 and attached to a 6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Dysoxylum cumingianum it exhibits antileukemic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an acetate ester, a monosaccharide derivative, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a triterpenoid saponin, an epoxide and a secondary alcohol.
