The molecule is a linear amino pentasaccharide comprising beta-D-glucose at the reducing end with a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galactosyl moiety at the 4-position. beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->3)-alpha-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-Glcp in which the anomeric configuration of the glucose residue at the reducing end is beta. It has a role as an antigen and an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->3)-alpha-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-Glcp.
