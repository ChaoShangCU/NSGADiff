The molecule is a cinnamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the 1-hydroxy group of beta-D-glucopyranose with the carboxy group of trans-caffeic acid. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of catechols and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a trans-caffeic acid.
