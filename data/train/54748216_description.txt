The molecule is an oligosaccharide derivative that is a derivative of an octasaccharide consisting of GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) disaccharide units with a Delta(4,5)HexUA(2-O-sulfate)alpha1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) disaccharide unit at the non-reducing end. It has been isolated from a partial chondroitinase ABC digest of a commercial shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate (CS-C) preparation. It has a role as a mimotope.
