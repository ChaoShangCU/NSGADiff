The molecule is a monomethoxyflavanone that is (2S)-7-methoxyflavanone substituted at position 8 by a tetrahydrofuran ring which in turn is substituted by geminal methyl groups at position 2, an acetoxy group at position 3 and a hydroxy group at position 5. Isolated from Tephrosia purpurea, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a monomethoxyflavanone, an acetate ester, a member of oxolanes and a secondary alcohol.
