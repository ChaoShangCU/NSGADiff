The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside in which an alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residue is attached at position 3 of quercetin via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated particularly from Juglans regia and Foeniculum vulgare. It has a role as a hepatoprotective agent and a plant metabolite. It is a monosaccharide derivative, an alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, a tetrahydroxyflavone and a quercetin O-glycoside.
