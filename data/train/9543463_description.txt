The molecule is a member of the class of pterocarpans that is (6aS,11aS)-6a,11a-dihydro-6H-[1]benzofuro[3,2-c]chromene which is substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3, a second hydroxy group at position 6a (resulting in the CIP stereochemical designation changing to R,R), and a methylenedioxy group at positions 8-9. It is a metabolite of the pea phytoalexin (+)-pisatin, produced by the pea-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum forma specialis pisi, and a number of other fungi, including Fusarium anruioides, Fusarium avenaceum, Mycosphaerella pinodes, and Stemphylium botryosum. It is a member of pterocarpans and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a (+)-maackiain.
