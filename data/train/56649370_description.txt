The molecule is a withanolide saponin that consists of withaferin A attached to a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the aerial parts of Physalis longifolia, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a withanolide saponin, a 4-hydroxy steroid, a disaccharide derivative, a delta-lactone, an ergostanoid and an epoxy steroid. It derives from a withaferin A.
