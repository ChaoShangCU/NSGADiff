The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (+)-taxifolin substituted by a beta-D-xylopyranosyl residue at position 3. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-D-xyloside, a member of 3'-hydroxyflavanones, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a tetrahydroxyflavanone. It derives from a (+)-taxifolin and a beta-D-xylose.
