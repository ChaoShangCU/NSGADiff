The molecule is a 2,6-diaminopurine that is an analogue of abacavir in which the cyclopropylamino group at position 6 of the purine moiety is replaced by a 3-isopropoxyazetidin-1-yl group. Unlike several other synthesised abacavir analogues, it is completely deficient in T-cell reactivity with abacavir-responsive clones. It derives from an abacavir.
