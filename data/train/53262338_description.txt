The molecule is a branched amino octasaccharide made up from two repeating (1->3)-linked N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-[alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)]-beta-D-galactosyl units that are in turn joined to N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactose via a (1->4)-linkage. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and an amino octasaccharide.
