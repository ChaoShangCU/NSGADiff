The molecule is an androstane sulfate that is 5alpha-androstan-3beta,17alpha-diol in which both hydroxy hydrogens have been replaced by sulfo groups. It derives from a 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17alpha-diol. It is a conjugate acid of a 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17alpha-diol disulfate anion and a 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17alpha-diol disulfate(2-).
