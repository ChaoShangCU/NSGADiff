The molecule is a hydroxycalciol that is calciol in which the hydrogen at position 25 has been replaced by a hydroxy group. A prehormone resulting from the oxidation of calciol in the liver, it is further hydroxylated in the kidney to give calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent, a nutraceutical, a vitamin, a metabolite, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a hydroxycalciol, a member of D3 vitamins and a diol.
