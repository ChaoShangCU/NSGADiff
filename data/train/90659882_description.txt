The molecule is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-3-hexenoic acid. It is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA, a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a trans-hex-3-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-3-hexenoyl-CoA(4-).
