The molecule is a docosanoid anion that is the conjugate base of (7Z,11Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-10,17-bis(hydroperoxy)docosapentaenoic acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a docosanoid anion and a long-chain fatty acid anion. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoate. It is a conjugate base of a (7Z,11Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-10,17-bis(hydroperoxy)docosapentaenoic acid.
