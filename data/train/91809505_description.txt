The molecule is a glycosphingolipid identical with alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) with the exception of the replacement of the C-2 carbonyl oxygen on the acyl chain with a sulfur atom. It has a role as an antigen. It is a thiocarboxamide and a glycosphingolipid. It derives from a 1-O-(alpha-D-galactosyl)-N-hexacosanoylphytosphingosine.
