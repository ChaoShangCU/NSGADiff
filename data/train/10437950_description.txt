The molecule is a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid that consists of dihydro-beta-agarofuran substituted by acetoxy group at positions 1 and 2, a benzoyloxy group at position 9 and furoyloxy groups at position 6 (the 1beta,2beta,9alpha,6alpha). Isolated from Celastrus orbiculatus, it exhibits inhibition of both NF-kappaB activation and nitric oxide production. It has a role as a metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and a NF-kappaB inhibitor. It is an acetate ester, a benzoate ester, a bridged compound, a cyclic ether, a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid and an organic heterotricyclic compound. It derives from a 3-furoic acid.
