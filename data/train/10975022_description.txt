The molecule is a kaempferol O-glucoside that consists of kaempferol attached to a alpha-L-[6'''-p-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-rhamnopyranosyl] moiety at position 3 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 via glycosidic linkages. Isolated from Ginkgo biloba and Mentha lavandulacea, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antioxidant. It is a cinnamate ester, a kaempferol O-glucoside and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid.
