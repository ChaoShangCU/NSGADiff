The molecule is a glucosyl hydroxycinnamic acid that is the cinnamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of trans-sinapic acid with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucose. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glucosyl hydroxycinnamic acid, a dimethoxybenzene, a monosaccharide derivative and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a beta-D-glucose and a trans-sinapic acid.
