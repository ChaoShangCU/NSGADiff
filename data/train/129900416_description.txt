The molecule is a fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (E)-hex-4-enoic acid. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a trans-hex-4-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (E)-hex-4-enoyl-CoA(4-).
