The molecule is a sprioketal resulting from the formal condensation of the 2'- and 3'- hydroxy groups of ATP with picric acid. It has a role as an antagonist. It is a C-nitro compound and a spiroketal. It derives from an ATP, a picric acid and a ({[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(9H-purin-9-yl)oxolan-2-yl]methyl phosphonato}oxy)(phosphonatooxy)phosphinate. It is a conjugate acid of a TNP-ATP(5-).
