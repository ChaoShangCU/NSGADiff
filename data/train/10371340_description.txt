The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5, 2' and 5', methyl groups at positions 6 and 8 and a (6''-O-p-hydroxybenzoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy residue at position 7. Isolated from the leaves of Myrcia multiflora, it exhibits inhibitory activity against aldose reductase. It has a role as an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a trihydroxyflavanone and a 4-hydroxybenzoate ester.
