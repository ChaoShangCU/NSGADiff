The molecule is an aryl beta-D-glucoside that is phloretin attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 4' via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the leaves of the Chinese sweet tea Lithocarpus polystachyus and exhibits significant anti-hyperglycemic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent, a sweetening agent, an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is an aryl beta-D-glucoside, a member of dihydrochalcones and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a phloretin.
