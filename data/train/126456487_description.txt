The molecule is an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 15-oxo-ETE. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is an enone, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 15-oxo-ETE. It is a conjugate acid of a 15-oxo-ETE-CoA(4-).
