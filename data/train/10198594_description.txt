The molecule is a delta-lactone that is 3,5,7,7a-tetrahydro-2H-furo[3,4-b]pyran-2-one substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3 and propenyl groups at positions 5 and 7. Isolated from the fermantation broth of Myceliophthora lutea TF-0409, it exhibits broad spectrum activity against cultured tumor cell lines, including adriamycin-resistant HL-60 cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a delta-lactone, an organic heterobicyclic compound and a secondary alcohol.
