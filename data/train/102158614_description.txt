The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin (tricin) in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 7 has been replaced by a neohesperidosyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a neohesperidoside, a dihydroxyflavone, a dimethoxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone and a polyphenol. It derives from a 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin.
