The molecule is an L-lysine derivative that is the aldimine obtained via formal condensation of the side-chain amino group of L-lysine with the carbonyl group of pyridoxal phosphate. It is a L-lysine derivative, an organic phosphate, an aldimine, a member of methylpyridines and a monohydroxypyridine. It derives from a pyridoxal.
