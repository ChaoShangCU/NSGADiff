The molecule is a sesqiterpenoid that is octahydro-1H-indene which is substituted by a 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl group at position 1, methyl groups at positions 3a and 7, and hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 7 (the 1R,3aR,4R,7S,7aR stereoisomer). It has been isolated from various Homalomena species. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a sesquiterpenoid, a carbobicyclic compound, a secondary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol and a triol. It derives from an oppsit-4(15)-ene-1beta,11-diol.
