The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is primulagenin A attached to a tetrasaccharide residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a diol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a tetrasaccharide derivative and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a primulagenin A. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
