The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of a linear chain of four alpha-linked D-mannose residues, with an N-acetyl glucosamine residue joined to residue 3, also via an alpha-linkage. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, an amino pentasaccharide and a (1->3)-alpha-D-mannooligosaccharide derivative.
