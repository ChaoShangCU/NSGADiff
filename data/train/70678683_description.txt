The molecule is an S-conjugate dipeptide consisting of L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteine in which the the cysteine side chain is substituted by a cyano(indol-3-yl)methyl group. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a S-conjugate, a member of indoles, a nitrile and a dipeptide. It derives from a gamma-glutamylcysteine and an indole-3-acetonitrile.
