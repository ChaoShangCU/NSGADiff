The molecule is a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate(4-) that is the tetraanion of 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate(dATP), arising from deprotonation of the four triphosphate OH groups; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a dATP(3-).
