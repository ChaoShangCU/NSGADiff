The molecule is a benzoate ester obtained by the formal condensation of 6''-hydroxy group of quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside with the carboxy group of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-galactoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a quercetin O-glycoside, a tetrahydroxyflavone and a benzoate ester. It derives from a quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside and a 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.
