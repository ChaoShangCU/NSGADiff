The molecule is a sterol 3-beta-D-glucoside that is ergosta-6,9,22-triene-3beta-ol with a peroxy group between positions 5 and 8 and is substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the fruit bodies of Chlorophyllum molybdites, it exhibits cytotoxicity against Kato III cells. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a fungal metabolite. It is a cholestanoid, an organic peroxide, a sterol 3-beta-D-glucoside and a monosaccharide derivative.
