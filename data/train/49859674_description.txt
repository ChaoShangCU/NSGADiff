The molecule is a xylose phosphate that is 3-O-(6-O-phosphono-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranose in which the dihydrogen phosphate group is condensed with the anomeric hydroxy group of alpha-D-xylose. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-O-(6-O-alpha-D-xylosylphospho-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-mannopyranose(1-).
