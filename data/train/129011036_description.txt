The molecule is the carbohydrate acid derivative anion formed from beta-D-GlcA3S-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-OC6H4-4-OMe by loss of two protons, one from each of its sulfo and carboxy groups. It is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and an organosulfate oxoanion. It is a conjugate base of a beta-D-GlcA3S-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-OC6H4-4-OMe.
