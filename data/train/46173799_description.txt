The molecule is a jadomycin that is jadomycin A in which the phenolic hydroxy group at position 12 has been converted to the corresponding 2,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-ribo-hexopyranoside, isolated from Streptomyces venezuelae. It exists as a diastereoisomeric mixture consisting of both 3aS and 3aR isomers. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an apoptosis inducer, an Aurora kinase inhibitor, an antibacterial agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a jadomycin, an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a glycoside. It derives from a jadomycin A.
