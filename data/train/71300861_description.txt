The molecule is a diastereoisomeric mixture of (3R,5S)- and (3R,5R)-pyrisoxazole. A novel isomeric fungicide primarily used for control of control tomato botrytis and also for fungal diseases of wheat and other crops. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.70 (sterol 14alpha-demethylase) inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It contains a (3R,5R)-pyrisoxazole and a (3R,5S)-pyrisoxazole.
