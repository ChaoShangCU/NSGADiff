The molecule is the fluoride salt of beryllium (+2 oxidation state). In the solid state it exists as a glass, with four-coordinate Be(2+) tetrahedral centres and two-coordinate fluoride centres. As a gas it adopts a linear triatomic structure and in the liquid state a fluctuating tetrahedral structure. In protein crystallography it is used as a mimic of phosphate. It is a beryllium molecular entity and a fluoride salt.
