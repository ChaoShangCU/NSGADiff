The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2E)-{2-[({(E)-[(3E)-4-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)but-3-en-2-ylidene]amino}oxy)methyl]phenyl}(methoxyimino)acetic acid with the amino group of methylamine. A broad-spectrum fungicide. It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an oxime O-ether, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an olefinic compound, a dichlorobenzene, an amide fungicide and a methoxyiminoacetamide strobilurin antifungal agent.
