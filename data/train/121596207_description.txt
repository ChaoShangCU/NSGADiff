The molecule is a class I yanuthone that is yanuthone K in which a hydrogen of the pro-E methyl group at the terminus of the farnesyl substituent has been replaced by a hydroxy group. Isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger, it shows antifungal activity towards the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (IC50 = 17.0 +-1.9 muM). It has a role as an antifungal agent and an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a class I yanuthone, an acetate ester and a primary alcohol. It derives from a yanuthone K.
