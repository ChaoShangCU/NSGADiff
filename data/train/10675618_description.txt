The molecule is a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid that consists of dihydro-beta-agarofuran substituted by an acetoxy group at position 1 and benzoyloxy groups at positions 2, 6 and 9 (the 1beta,2beta,6alpha,9alpha stereoisomers). Isolated from the roots of Celastrus orbiculatus and Microtropis fokienensis and exhibits cytotoxic and antitubercular properties. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antitubercular agent, a NF-kappaB inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a benzoate ester, a bridged compound, an acetate ester, a cyclic ether, a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid and an organic heterotricyclic compound.
