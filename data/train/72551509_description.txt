The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-octacosaheptaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-octacosaheptaenoyl-CoA(4-).
