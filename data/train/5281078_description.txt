The molecule is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation between the carboxylic acid group of mycophenolic acid and the hydroxy group of 2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethanol. In the liver, it is metabolised to mycophenolic acid, an immunosuppressant for which it is a prodrug. It is widely used to prevent tissue rejection following organ transplants as well as for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. It has a role as an immunosuppressive agent, a prodrug, an EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP dehydrogenase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a gamma-lactone, a member of phenols, an ether, a carboxylic ester and a tertiary amino compound. It derives from a mycophenolic acid and a 2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethanol.
