The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is chrysoeriol in which the hydroxyl hydrogen at position 7 is replaced by a 6-p-coumaroylglucosyl residue. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a cinnamate ester, a dihydroxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a 4',5,7-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone and a 4-coumaric acid.
