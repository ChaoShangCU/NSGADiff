The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (2E,7Z)-tetradecadienoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a 4,5-saturated-trans-2-enoyl-CoA(4-), a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (2E,7Z)-hexadecadienoyl-CoA.
