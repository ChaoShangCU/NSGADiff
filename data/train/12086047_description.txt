The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoester obtained by formal condensation of one of the carboxy groups of succinic acid with the side-chain hydroxy group of L-serine. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the amino acid cysteine in fungi and bacteria. It has a role as an EC 2.5.1.48 (cystathionine gamma-synthase) inhibitor. It is a L-serine derivative, an amino dicarboxylic acid and a hemisuccinate. It is a conjugate acid of an O-succinyl-L-serinate(1-).
