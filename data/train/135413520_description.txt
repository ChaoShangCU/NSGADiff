The molecule is an organic sodium salt that is the disodium salt of N-{4-[2-(2-amino-4-oxo-4,7-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl}-L-glutamic acid. Inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), 421 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite, an EC 1.5.1.3 (dihydrofolate reductase) inhibitor, an EC 2.1.2.2 (phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase) inhibitor and an EC 2.1.1.45 (thymidylate synthase) inhibitor. It contains a pemetrexed(2-).
