The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of s-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranose and beta-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. It is a member of acetamides, an amino disaccharide and a glycosylgalactose derivative. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine and a beta-D-galactose.
