The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose residu joined in sequence by (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from an alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
