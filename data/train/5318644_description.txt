The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is isorhamnetin substituted at position 3 by a beta-D-galactosyl residue. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-D-galactoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone and a trihydroxyflavone. It derives from an isorhamnetin and a beta-D-galactose.
