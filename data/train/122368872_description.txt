The molecule is a docosanoid that is (14S)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid in which a cysteinylglycinyl group is attached at position 13R via a sulfide linkage. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a docosanoid, an organic sulfide, a secondary alcohol, a dicarboxylic acid and a dipeptide. It is a conjugate acid of a (13R)-glycinylcystein-S-yl-(14S)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoate(1-).
