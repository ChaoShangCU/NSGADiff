The molecule is a carbocyclic fatty acid that is cyclopent-2-en-1-one which has been substituted at positions 4 and 5 by 5-carboxypentyl and (2ZZ)-pent-2-en-1-yl groups, respectively (the S,S stereoisomer). It is an intermediate in the synthesis of jasmonic acid from hexadecatrienoic acid. It is a carbocyclic fatty acid, an oxo fatty acid, an enone and a polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 6-{(1S,5S)-4-oxo-5-[(2Z)-pent-2-en-1-yl]cyclopent-2-en-1-yl}hexanoate.
