The molecule is a tricyclic triterpenoid that is perhydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]naphthalene that is substituted bu methyl groups at positions 3a, 6, 6, and 9a, by a hydroxy group at position 7, and by a (2R,5E)-2-hydroxy-6,10-dimethylundeca-5,9-dien-2-yl group at position 3 (the 3R,3aR,5aR,7S,9aR,9bR-isomer). It is a secondary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol and a tricyclic triterpenoid.
