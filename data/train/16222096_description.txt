The molecule is a member of the class of N-acylazetidines obtained by selective formal condensation of the carboxy group of 3,4-difluoro-2-(2-fluoro-4-iodoanilino)benzoic acid with the secondary amino group from the azetidine ring of 3-[(2S)-piperidin-2-yl]azetidin-3-ol. An inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase that is used (as its fumarate salt) in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.24 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of piperidines, a N-acylazetidine, a tertiary alcohol, an aromatic amine, a secondary amino compound, a difluorobenzene and an organoiodine compound. It is a conjugate base of a cobimetinib(1+).
