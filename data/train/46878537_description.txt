The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid anion that is the conjugate base of alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-(2->6)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid function of the alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl residue. It is a monocarboxylic acid anion, an anionic ganglioside and a N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl-(2->6)-beta-D-galactoside(1-). It is a conjugate base of an alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-(2->6)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine.
