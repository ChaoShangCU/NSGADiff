The molecule is a dihydroxyflavone that is tricin 4'-O-(erythro-beta-guaiacylglyceryl) ether in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 9'' has been replaced by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a dihydroxyflavone, a dimethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a polyphenol. It derives from a (-)-(7R,8S)-guaiacylglycerol and a 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin.
