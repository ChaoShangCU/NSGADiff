The molecule is a linear tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of an alpha-L-rhamnosyl residue glycosidically linked to a 5-aminopentyl group and which carries at O-3 an alpha-D-glucuronosyl-(1->6)-alpha-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnosyl trisaccharide unit. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
