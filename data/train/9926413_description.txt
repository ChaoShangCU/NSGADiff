The molecule is a member of the class xanthones which consists of a dihydroxanthone skeleton substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 8, a methyl group at position 6 and a methoxycarbonyl group at position 4a (the 4R,4aS stereoisomer). It is isolated from Emericella nidulans var lata and Penicillium and exhibits potent antitumour activity against both human and murine tumour cell lines. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an antineoplastic agent and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a member of xanthones, a member of phenols and a methyl ester.
