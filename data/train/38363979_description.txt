The molecule is a notoamide that is 2-(2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl)-7-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-1H-indol-6-ol which has been substituted at position 3 by a [(3S,8aS)-1,4-dioxooctahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl]methyl group. Isolated from a mussel-derived Aspergillus species. The precursor of notoamide E. It has a role as a mycotoxin. It is a dipeptide, a pyrrolopyrazine, a notoamide and a member of hydroxyindoles.
