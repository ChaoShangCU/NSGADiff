The molecule is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (8R)-8-hydroxynonanoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). A metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it is the direct biosynthetic precursor to ascr#3. It has also been detected in the sour paste nematode, Panagrellus redivivus. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a monocarboxylic acid and an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from an (8R)-8-hydroxynonanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an ascr#10(1-).
