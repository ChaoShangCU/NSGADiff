The molecule is an aryl sulfate that is (2E)-3-phenylprop-2-enoic acid which is substituted by a sulfooxy group at position 4. It is produced by the seagrass Zostera marina and has very promising antifouling potential against several micro- and macrofouling organisms. It has a role as an antifouling biocide and a plant metabolite. It is an aryl sulfate and a member of cinnamic acids.
