The molecule is a sesquiterpene alkaloid that is a macrolide incorporating a substituted dihydroagarofuran and a pyrindine ring. Isolated from Maytenus emarginata, it exhibits strong cytotoxicity against human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx (KB), ileocecal adenocarcinoma (HCT-8), melanoma (RPMI-7951) and medulloblastoma (TE-671) tumor cells, and against murine leukemia (P-388). It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an acetate ester, a benzoate ester, a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid, a macrolide, a member of methylpyridines, a pyridine alkaloid, a pyridone and a sesquiterpene alkaloid. It derives from an evonine.
