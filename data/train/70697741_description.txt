The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-18-ene substituted by a carboxy group at position 28 and oxo groups at positions 3 and 21 respectively. Isolated from the leaves of Acacia aulacocarpa, it exhibits inhibitory activity against Tie2 kinase (EC 2.7.10.1) as well as modest activity against a variety of cultured mammalian cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a dioxo monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
