The molecule is an anthocyanin cation consisting of delphinidin having a rutinosyl [6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucosyl] residue attached at the 3-hydroxy position and a beta-D-glucosyl residue at the 7-hydroxy position. It is a rutinoside, a beta-D-glucoside, a disaccharide derivative and an anthocyanin cation. It derives from a delphinidin. It is a conjugate acid of a delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside-7-O-beta-D-glucoside betaine.
