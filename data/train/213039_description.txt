The molecule is an N,N-disubstituted benzenesulfonamide bearing an unsubstituted amino group at the 4-position, used for the treatment of HIV infection. A second-generation HIV protease inhibitor, darunavir was designed to form robust interactions with the protease enzyme from many strains of HIV, including those from treatment-experienced patients with multiple resistance mutations to other protease inhibitors. It has a role as a HIV protease inhibitor and an antiviral drug. It is a furofuran, a carbamate ester and a sulfonamide.
