The molecule is an epoxy(hydroxy)icosatrienoate that is the conjugate base of 5,6-epoxy-20-hydroxy-(8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid function; major species at pH 7.3. It is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid anion, an icosanoid anion, a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion and a hydroxy fatty acid anion. It derives from a 5,6-EET(1-). It is a conjugate base of a 5,6-epoxy-20-hydroxy-(8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoic acid.
