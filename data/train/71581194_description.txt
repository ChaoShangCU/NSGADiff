The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosahexaenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a very long-chain acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosahexaenoyl-CoA.
