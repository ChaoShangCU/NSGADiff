The molecule is a carbamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the phenolic group of 3,5-dimethyl-4-(methylsulfanyl)phenol with the carboxy group of methylcarbamic acid. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a molluscicide, an acaricide, an agrochemical, an avicide, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an insecticide. It is a carbamate ester and an aryl sulfide. It derives from a methylcarbamic acid and a 3,5-dimethyl-4-(methylsulfanyl)phenol.
