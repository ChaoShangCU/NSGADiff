The molecule is a diterpenoid that is 15,17-epoxypodocarpan-15-one substituted by a hydroxy group at position 13, methyl groups at positions 8 and 13 and a (5-methoxy-3,6-dioxocyclohexa-1,4-dien-1-yl)methyl group at position 14 (the 13alpha,14beta stereoisomer). Isolated from the marine sponge Petrosia corticata, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an animal metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is a diterpenoid, a meroterpenoid, a gamma-lactone, an enol ether, a tertiary alcohol and a member of p-quinones.
