The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin (tricin) in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 7 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a radical scavenger and a xenobiotic metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a dihydroxyflavone, a dimethoxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a polyphenol. It derives from a 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin.
