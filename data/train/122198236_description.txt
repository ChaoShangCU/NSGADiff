The molecule is a glutathione conjugate obtained by formal 1,4-addition of the thiol function of glutathione to the enone function of prostaglandin A2 (where the newly formed stereocentre at position 11 has S-configuration). It is a glutathione conjugate, an organic sulfide and a prostanoid. It derives from a prostaglandin A2. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-PGA2-S-glutathione conjugate(2-).
