The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosahexaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosahexaenoyl-CoA(4-).
