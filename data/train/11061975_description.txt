The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that consists of urs-11-ene substituted by an epoxy group across positions 13 and 28, a hydroxy group at position 16 and a beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 3 (the 3beta,16alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from the fruits of Bupleurum rotundifolium, it exhibits antiproliferative activity against cancer cells. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a trisaccharide derivative, a cyclic ether and a bridged compound. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
