The molecule is a branched polysaccharide acid oxoanion comprised of an octasaccharide repeating unit consisting of a backbone of two glucose and two glucuronate residues, and a side chain of three glucose and one galactose residues. The octasaccharide is modified by two non-stoichiometric O-acetyl groups and one non-stoichiometric hydroxybutanoyl group. Note that the structure shown and its molfile represent only one of the possible substitution patterns.
