The molecule is a dibenzooxepine diterpenoid that is hexahydrodibenzo[b,e]oxepine-2-carboxylic acid with an isolated double bond between positions 6 and 6a and is substituted by a bromo, 2-[(1S,3S,6S)-3-bromo-6-hydroxy-2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexyl]ethyl and a methyl group at positions 9, 10 and 10 respectively (the 9S,10S,10aR stereoisomer). An isomer of callophycoic acid C, it is isolated from the Fijian red alga Callophycus serratus and exhibits antibacterial, antimalarial and anticancer activities. It has a role as a metabolite, an antibacterial agent, an antimalarial and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of benzoic acids, a cyclic ether, a dibenzooxepine, a diterpenoid, an organobromine compound and a tertiary alcohol.
