The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion that is the trianion of isopentenyl diphosphate arising from deprotonation of the three OH groups of the diphosphate. It has a role as an epitope, a phosphoantigen, a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a conjugate base of an isopentenyl diphosphate.
