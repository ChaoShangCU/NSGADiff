The molecule is a (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid oligomer resulting from the formal intermolecular condensation of the hydroxy and carboxy groups of (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid to give a chain in which four units of the monomer are linked together by three ester bonds. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It derives from a (3R)-3-{[(3R)-3-{[(3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl]oxy}butanoyl]oxy}butanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R)-3-{[(3R)-3-{[(3R)-3-{[(3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl]oxy}butanoyl]oxy}butanoyl]oxy}butanoate.
