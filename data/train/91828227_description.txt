The molecule is a branched pentasaccharide consisting of a trisaccharide chain of alpha-D-galactose, beta-D-galactose and beta-D-glucose residues linked sequentially (1->3) and (1->4), with alpha-L-fucosyl residues attached by (1->2) and (1->3) linkages to the beta-D-galactose and beta-D-glucose residues respectively. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)]-beta-D-Glcp.
