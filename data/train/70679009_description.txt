The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprised of a linear chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues, all linked sequentially (1->4), to each N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue of which is (1->3)-linked an alpha-L-fucosyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
