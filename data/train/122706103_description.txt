The molecule is a mycosporine-like amino acid that is the ketimine resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of L-serine with the keto group of (5S)-5-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxycyclohex-2-en-1-one and in which the hydrogen at position 3 of the cyclohexenone moiety has been replaced by the amino group of glycine. It is an active ingredient found in environmentally friendly sunscreen creams. It has a role as an ultraviolet filter and an antioxidant.
