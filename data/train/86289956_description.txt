The molecule is a member of the class of agrocinopines that consists of beta-D-fructose and L-arabinose units joined via a phosphodiester linkage between position 4 of fructose and position 2 of arabinose. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It derives from a beta-D-fructofuranose and a L-arabinopyranose.
