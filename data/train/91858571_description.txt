The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of two alpha-D-mannopyranose residues and a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residue joined in sequence by (1->2) and (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from an alpha-D-Manp-(1->2)-alpha-D-Manp.
