The molecule is a methyl glycoside that is beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-[beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-Glc-(1->6)]-beta-D-GlcNAc in which the CH2OH of the galactose within the trisaccharide chain is replaced by anionic carboxylate and the hydroxy group at the reducing-end anomeric centre is methylated. It is a methyl glycoside and a carbohydrate acid derivative anion. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->6)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
