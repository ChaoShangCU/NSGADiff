The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is barringtogenol C which is acetylated at position 28 and attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an acetate ester, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a trisaccharide derivative, a triterpenoid saponin and a triol. It derives from a barringtogenol C. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
