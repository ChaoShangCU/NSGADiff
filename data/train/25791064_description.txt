The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside resulting from the formal condensation of the phenolic hydroxy group of (E)-sinapaldehyde with beta-D-glucose. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a dimethoxybenzene and a member of cinnamaldehydes. It derives from an (E)-sinapaldehyde.
