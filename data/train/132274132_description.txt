The molecule is a glycopeptide consisting of the Ara6 epitope attached to an Ala-Asn-Ser-Ser-Phe-Ala-Pro-NH2 heptapeptide via a [(2-hydroxyethoxy)imino]acetyl linker. It contains a beta-D-Araf-(1->2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1->5)-[beta-D-Araf-(1->2)-alpha-D-Araf-(1->3)]-alpha-D-Araf-(1->5)-alpha-D-Araf-yl group.
