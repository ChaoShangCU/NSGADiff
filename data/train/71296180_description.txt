The molecule is a papulacandin substituted by a (2E,4E)-deca-2,4-dienoyl chain at the O-(6') position and a (2E,4E,7S,8E,10E,14S)-7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethylhexadeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenoyl chain at the O-(3) position. It is a carbohydrate-containing antibiotic from the deuteromycetous fungus Papularia sphaerosperma which shows potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans. It has a role as an antifungal agent and a metabolite. It is a papulacandin, a disaccharide derivative and an organic heterotricyclic compound. It derives from a (2E,4E)-deca-2,4-dienoic acid and an alpha-lactose.
