The molecule is a gamma-lactam that is 1,3-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one in which the hydrogen at position 4 has been replaced by a hydroxy group. Despite its simple structure, it was not synthesised until 1972; earlier attempts were later shown to have resulted only in the formation of the isomer 5-imino-4,5-dihydrofuran-3-ol. It is an enol, a gamma-lactam and a member of pyrroles.
