The molecule is the anhydrous form of the bromide salt of ipratropium. An anticholinergic drug, ipratropium bromide blocks the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the smooth muscles of the bronchi in the lungs. This opens the bronchi, so providing relief in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute asthma. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, a muscarinic antagonist and an antispasmodic drug. It contains an ipratropium.
