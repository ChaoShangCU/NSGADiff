The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is (23Z)-24-methyllanosta-8,23,25-trien-21-oic acid substituted by an acetyloxy group at position 3 and a beta-D-xylopyranosyl residue at position 21 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the fruit bodied of Ganoderma tsugae and exhibits cytotoxic activity against several different cancer cell lines. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a fungal metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, an acetate ester and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a hydride of a lanostane.
