The molecule is a six-membered oligosaccharide phosphate antigen consisting of four 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulose residues and two glucosamine residues (one at the reducing end) in a branched sequence, with two phosphate groups attached. It has a role as an epitope. It is an oligosaccharide phosphate and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
