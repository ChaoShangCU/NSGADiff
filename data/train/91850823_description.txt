The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of 2-O-sulfo-alpha-L-idopyranuronic acid and 2-acetamido-D-galatopyranose residues joined by a (1->3) glycosidic bond. It is an amino disaccharide, an oligosaccharide sulfate, a carbohydrate acid derivative and a member of acetamides. It derives from a N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and a 2-O-sulfo-alpha-L-idopyranuronic acid.
