The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is hederagenin attached to an alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a monosaccharide derivative, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and an alpha-L-arabinopyranoside. It derives from a hederagenin. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
