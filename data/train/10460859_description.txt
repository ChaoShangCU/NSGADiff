The molecule is a biflavonoid that is a dimer resulting from the coupling of 7,4'-dimethoxy-5-hydroxy-6-methylflavone and 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone resulting in a bond between C-3' of the methoxyphenyl ring and C-8 of the chromene ring respectively. Isolated from Cephalotaxus wilsoniana, it exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a biflavonoid, a biaryl, a hydroxyflavone and a methoxyflavone.
