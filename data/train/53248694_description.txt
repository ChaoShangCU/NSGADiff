The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid that is calcitriol in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 25 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a steroid glucosiduronic acid, a member of D3 vitamins and a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid. It derives from a calcitriol. It is a conjugate acid of a calcitriol 25-O-(beta-D-glucuronate).
