The molecule is a spirostanyl glycoside that is agigenin attached to a pentasaccharide unit via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the flowers of Allium leucanthum, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pentasaccharide derivative, a spirostanyl glycoside and a 2alpha-hydroxy steroid. It derives from an agigenin.
