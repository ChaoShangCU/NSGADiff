The molecule is the glycosyloxyflavone resulting from the condensation of the hydroxy group at position 7 of luteolin with the 1 position of 2-O-beta-D-glucopyranuronosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid. It is a trihydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone, a dicarboxylic acid, a disaccharide derivative and a luteolin O-glucuronoside. It is a conjugate acid of a luteolin 7-O-[(beta-D-glucosiduronate)-(1->2)-(beta-D-glucosiduronate)].
