The molecule is a 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate(2-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate OH groups of 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-monophosphate (dCMP); major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-monophosphate(2-) and a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-phosphate(2-). It is a conjugate base of a 2'-deoxycytosine 5'-monophosphate.
