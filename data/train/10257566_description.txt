The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid that is calcidiol in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 3 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, a member of D3 vitamins and a steroid glucosiduronic acid. It derives from a calcidiol. It is a conjugate acid of a calcidiol 3-O-(beta-D-glucuronate).
