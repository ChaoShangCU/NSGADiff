The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (9Z,12Z)-hexadecadienoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (9Z,12Z)-hexadecadienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,12Z)-hexadecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
