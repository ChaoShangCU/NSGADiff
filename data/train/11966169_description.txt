The molecule is an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxylic acid group of 3-oxolauroic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a 3-oxolauric acid and a lauroyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-oxolauroyl-CoA(4-).
