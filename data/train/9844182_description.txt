The molecule is a 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide resulting from the reaction of equimolar amounts of escitalopram and hydrogen bromide. It has a role as a serotonin uptake inhibitor and an antidepressant. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-citalopram hydrobromide.
