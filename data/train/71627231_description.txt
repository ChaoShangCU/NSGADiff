The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (10Z,13Z,16Z)-3-oxodocosatrienoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (10Z,13Z,16Z)-3-oxodocosatrienoyl-CoA(4-).
