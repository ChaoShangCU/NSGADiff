The molecule is a glycoside consisting of a linear hexasaccharide of N-formyl-alpha-D-perosamine residues linked (1->2) throughout, and linked at the reducing end glycosidically to a 5-(methoxycarbonyl)pentyl group used to facilitate conjugation to proteins. It is a glycoside, a methyl ester and a hexasaccharide derivative.
