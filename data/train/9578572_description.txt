The molecule is an aromatic amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-{[(4-{N'-[(hexyloxy)carbonyl]carbamimidoyl}phenyl)amino]methyl}-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid with the secondary amino group of ethyl N-pyridin-2-yl-beta-alaninate. A prodrug for dabigatran, a thrombin inhibitor and anticoagulant which is used for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. It has a role as an anticoagulant, a prodrug and an EC 3.4.21.5 (thrombin) inhibitor. It is a member of benzimidazoles, an aromatic amide, a carboxylic ester, a carboxamidine, a member of pyridines and a beta-alanine derivative. It derives from a dabigatran. It is a conjugate base of a dabigatran etexilate(1+).
