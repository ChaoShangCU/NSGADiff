The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside that is zeaxanthin in which both hydroxy groups have been converted to the corresponding glucosides. It is one of the most polar carotenoids found in nature (solubility in water is 800 ppm, compared with only 12.6 ppm for zeaxanthin itself). It is a beta-D-glucoside and a carotenoid. It derives from a zeaxanthin.
