The molecule is a member of the class of chalcones that is chalcone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 4, 2' and 4', a geranyl group at position 3' and a 6,6-dimethyl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran ring fused across positions 5' and 6'. Isolated from the fruits of Mallotus philippensis, it exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities. It has a role as a metabolite, an anti-inflammatory agent, an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor and a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. It is a member of chalcones, a chromenol and a polyphenol.
