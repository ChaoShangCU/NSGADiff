The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is the carboxylic ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of asiatic acid with beta,23alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid 28-O-beta-D-glucopyranose. It has been isolated from Juglans sinensis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a triterpenoid saponin, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a carboxylic ester. It derives from an asiatic acid. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
