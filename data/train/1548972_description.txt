The molecule is a racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (3R,5S)- and (3S,5R)-fluvastatin. An HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, it is used (often as the corresponding sodium salt) to reduce triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol, and increase HDL-chloesterol, in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. It has a role as an EC 3.4.24.83 (anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase) inhibitor and an anticholesteremic drug. It is a racemate and a statin (synthetic). It contains a (3S,5R)-fluvastatin and a (3R,5S)-fluvastatin.
