The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (8Z,11Z)-icosadienoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of an (8Z,11Z)-icosadienoyl-CoA(4-).
