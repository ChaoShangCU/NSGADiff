The molecule is a docosanoid anion obtained by deprotonation of the three carboxy groups and protonation of the glutamyl alpha-amino group of (8S)-glutathionyl-(7R,17S)-dihydroxy-(4Z,9,11,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is a docosanoid anion, a peptide anion and a tricarboxylic acid dianion. It is a conjugate base of an (8S)-glutathionyl-(7R,17S)-dihydroxy-(4Z,9,11,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid.
