The molecule is a fully synthetic macrocyclic ketone analogue of marine sponge natural products. Inhibits growth phase of microtubules via tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism, which leads to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-destabilising agent. It is a macrocycle, a polyether, a polycyclic ether, a cyclic ketone, a primary amino compound and a cyclic ketal. It is a conjugate base of an eribulin(1+).
