The molecule is a glucooligosaccharide consisting of five beta-D-glucosyl residues and a D-glucosyl resicuejoined in sequence by (1->6), (1->6), (1->3), (1->6), and (1->6) glycosidic bonds in which the hydroxy group at position 3 of the terminal residue (bearing the anomeric hydroxy group) has been glycosylated by a beta-D-glucosyl group. It is a glucooligosaccharide, a heptasaccharide and a beta-D-glucoside.
