The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide epitope consisting of three 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulose residues and two N-acetylglucosamine residues (one at the reducing end) in a linear sequence, with one phosphate group attached. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide, an oligosaccharide phosphate and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
