The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z)-3-oxohexacosatetraenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a very long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of an (11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z)-3-oxohexacosatetraenoyl-CoA.
