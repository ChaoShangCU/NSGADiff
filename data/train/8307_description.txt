The molecule is the chloride salt of edrophonium. A reversible inhibitor of cholinesterase with a rapid onset (30-60 seconds after injection) but a short duration of action (5-15 minutes), it is used in myasthenia gravis both diagnostically and to distinguish between under- or over-treatment with other anticholinesterases. It has also been used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade in anaesthesia, and for the management of poisoning due to tetrodotoxin, a neuromuscular blocking toxin found in puffer fish and other marine animals. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, a diagnostic agent and an antidote. It is a quaternary ammonium salt and a chloride salt. It contains an edrophonium.
