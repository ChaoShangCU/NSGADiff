The molecule is an amino trisaccharide comprised of a linear sequence of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine linked (1->4) and (1->6); beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-GalpNAc with alpha anomeric configuration at the reducing-end. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino trisaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-GalpNAc.
