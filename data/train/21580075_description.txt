The molecule is an arabidopside in which the glyceride moiety is acylated by cis-12-oxophytodienoyl and cis-dinor-oxyphytodienoyl groups at positions 1 and 2, respectively, and in which the carbohydrate moiety is a beta-D-galactopyranosyl group. The cyclopentenone moiety of both acyl groups is cis-disubstituted. It is an arabidopside, a beta-D-galactoside, a 1,2-diacyl-3-beta-D-galactosyl-sn-glycerol and a diester.
