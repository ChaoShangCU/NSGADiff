The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of D-galactopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->4) and (1->3) glycosidic bonds. The alpha/beta configuration at position 1 of each of the pyranose rings is not stated. It is a member of acetamides, an amino trisaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a partially-defined glycan. It derives from a D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc.
