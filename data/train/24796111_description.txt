The molecule is a lignan that consists of cinnamaldehyde substituted by a methoxy group at position 2 and a 4-allylphenolic group at position 5. Isolated from Magnolia obovata, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a lignan, a monomethoxybenzene, an enal and a member of hydroxybiphenyls. It derives from an (E)-cinnamaldehyde.
