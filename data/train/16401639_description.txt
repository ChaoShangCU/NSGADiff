The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside that is steviolmonoside in which the hydroxy group at position 2 of the glucoside moiety has been converted into its beta-D-glucoside. It has a role as a sweetening agent, a plant metabolite and an antitubercular agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an ent-kaurane diterpenoid, a monocarboxylic acid, a bridged compound, a diterpene glycoside and a tetracyclic diterpenoid. It derives from a steviolmonoside. It is a conjugate acid of a steviolbioside(1-).
