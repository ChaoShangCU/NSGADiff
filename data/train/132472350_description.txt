The molecule is a docosanoid anion obtained by deprotonation of the two carboxy groups and protonation of the alpha-amino group of 16(S)-glycinylcystein-S-yl-17(R)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,10,12,14,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is a docosanoid anion, a peptide anion and a dicarboxylic acid monoanion. It is a conjugate base of a 16(S)-glycinylcystein-S-yl-17(R)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,10,12,14,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid.
