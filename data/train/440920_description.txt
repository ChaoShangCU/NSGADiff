The molecule is a nitrile that is L-glutamine in which one of the hydrogens attached to the amide nitrogen is replaced by a 2-cyanoethyl group. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid, a L-glutamine derivative, an aliphatic nitrile and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a beta-aminopropionitrile.
