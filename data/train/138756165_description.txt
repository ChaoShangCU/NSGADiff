The molecule is a long-chain fatty acid anion resulting from the deprotonation of the carboxy group of (9Z)-17-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid 17-O-beta-D-glucoside. It is a long-chain fatty acid anion and a monounsaturated fatty acid anion. It derives from a (9Z)-17-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoate. It is a conjugate base of a (9Z)-17-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid 17-O-beta-D-glucoside.
