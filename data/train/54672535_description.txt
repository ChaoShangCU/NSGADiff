The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that is quercetin attached to a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 via glycosidic linkages. It has been isolated from Anthyllis hermanniae. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a quercetin O-glycoside and a trihydroxyflavone.
