The molecule is an enamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of trans-cinnamic acid with the secondary amino group of (2R,5R)-1,2,5-trimethylpiperazine. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a N-acylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, an alkaloid, an enamide and a tertiary carboxamide. It derives from a trans-cinnamic acid.
