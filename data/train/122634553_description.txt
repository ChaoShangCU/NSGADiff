The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 3',4'-difluoro-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of 4'-fluoro-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-amine. It is an beta-catenin/BCL9 protein-protein interaction inhibitor. It has a role as a Wnt signalling inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a difluorobenzene, a member of monofluorobenzenes, a member of pyrrolidines, an aromatic ether, a secondary carboxamide and a diether. It is a conjugate base of a 3',4'-difluoro-N-{4'-fluoro-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-yl}-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-carboxamide(2+).
