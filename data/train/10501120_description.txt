The molecule is a cinnamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of trans-cinnamic acid with the 9-hydroxy group of 7,9-dihydroxy-8,10-dimethyltrideca-2,4-dienamide (the 4R,5S,6R,7R,9E,11Z stereoisomer). It is obtained from the fermentation broth of Bacillus sp.YL-03709B and exhibits antifungal activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an antimicrobial agent and an antifungal agent. It is an enamide, a secondary alcohol, a cinnamate ester and a primary carboxamide.
