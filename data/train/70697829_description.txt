The molecule is a steroid saponin that is (5alpha,6alpha,22R,25S)-6,22,26-trihydroxyfurostan-3-one in which the hydroxy group at position 6 has been converted into the beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->3)-alpha-L-rhamnoside derivative, while that at position 26 has been converted to its beta-D-glucoside. Torvoside H is a natural product found in the fruit of Solanum torvum which shows antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1. It has a role as a metabolite and an antiviral agent. It is a steroid saponin, a disaccharide derivative, a cyclic hemiketal, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a 3-oxo-5alpha-steroid.
