The molecule is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (3E,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA(4-), a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a 4-saturated-trans-3-enoyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (3E,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl-CoA.
