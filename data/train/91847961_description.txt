The molecule is an oligosaccharide sulfate consisting of 3-O-sulfo-beta-D-galactopyranose and -2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residues joined by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. It is an amino disaccharide, an oligosaccharide sulfate and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc, a N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and a 3-O-sulfo-beta-D-galactose.
