The molecule is a docosanoid that is (4Z,7Z,11Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at positions 10 and 17. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a hydroperoxy fatty acid, a lipid hydroperoxide, a docosanoid and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate base of a (4Z,7Z,11Z,13Z,15E,17S,19Z)-10,17-bis(hydroperoxy)docosahexaenoate.
