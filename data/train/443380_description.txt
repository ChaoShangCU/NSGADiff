The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoamide obtained by formal condensation between the amino group of cis-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid and the cyclopentanecarboxylic acid group of 1-[(2S)-2-carboxy-3-(2-methoxyethoxy)propyl]cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. A potent inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP, neprilysin, EC 3.4.24.11), it is used as its 2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-yl ester prodrug in the treatment of chronic heart failure. It has a role as an EC 3.4.24.* (metalloendopeptidase) inhibitor. It is a dicarboxylic acid and a dicarboxylic acid monoamide.
