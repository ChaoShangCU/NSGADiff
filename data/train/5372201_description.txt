The molecule is an alkaloid enamide that is (2E,4E)-N-(2-methylpropyl)nona-2,4-dienamide substituted at position 9 by a 1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl group. Isolated from Piper sarmentosum, it has been found to induce apoptosis in HT-29 cells. It has a role as a metabolite, an apoptosis inducer and a plant metabolite. It is an alkaloid, an enamide, a member of benzodioxoles and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a 2-methylpropanamine.
