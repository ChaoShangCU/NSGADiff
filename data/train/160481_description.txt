The molecule is a dihydroxyflavanone that is flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5 and 7 and a methoxy group at position 4' (the 2S stereoisomer). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a dihydroxyflavanone, a monomethoxyflavanone, a member of 4'-methoxyflavanones and a (2S)-flavan-4-one. It derives from a (S)-naringenin.
