The molecule is an isoquinoline alkaloid that is a dimer of 10-methoxydehydroanonaine. Isolated from the roots of Polyalthia debilis, it exhibits moderate antimalarial activity by inhibiting the growth of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. It has a role as a metabolite and an antimalarial. It is an aromatic ether, a biaryl, an isoquinoline alkaloid, a member of isoquinolines and an oxacycle. It derives from a (-)-annonaine.
