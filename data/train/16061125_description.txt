The molecule is a member of the class of resolvins that is (6E,8Z,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 5 and 18 (the 5S,18R stereoisomer). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent, a human xenobiotic metabolite and a rat metabolite. It is a resolvin, a diol, a secondary allylic alcohol and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a resolvin E2(1-).
