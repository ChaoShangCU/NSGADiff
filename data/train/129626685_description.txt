The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the phosphate to the amino group of 2-(11R)-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,12E,14Z)-icosatetraenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; major species at pH 7.3. It is a tautomer of a 2-[(11R)-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,12E,14Z)-icosatetraenoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
