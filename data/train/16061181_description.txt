The molecule is an N-(polyunsaturated fatty acyl)ethanolamine obtained by formal epoxidation across the 5,6-double bond of anandamide. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a N-(polyunsaturated fatty acyl)ethanolamine, a N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine, an endocannabinoid and an epoxide. It derives from an anandamide and a 5,6-EET.
