The molecule is a sulfonium betaine that is the conjugate base of S-adenosyl-4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoic acid, arising from deprotonation of the carboxy group. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a sulfonium betaine and a carboxylic acid anion. It derives from a 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate. It is a conjugate base of a S-adenosyl-4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoic acid.
