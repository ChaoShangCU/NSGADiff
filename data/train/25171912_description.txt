The molecule is a sulfoglycolipid in which alpha,alpha-trehalose, sulfated at the 2'-position, is acylated at the 2-position with octanoic acid, and at the 3-position with (2E,4S,6S,8S)-2,4,6,8-tetramethyltetracos-2-enoic acid. It is a sulfoglycolipid, a polyacyl alpha,alpha-trehalose derivative and an octanoate ester. It derives from an alpha,alpha-trehalose.
