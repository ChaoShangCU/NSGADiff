The molecule is a glycoside that is beta-D-xylose in which the hydrogen of the anomeric hydroxy group is replaced by a 4-aminobutyl group. A synthetic version of the beta-xylosyl glycoside (BXG) epitope from the major peanut allergen glycoprotein Arachis hypogaea h2 (Ara-h2). It has a role as an epitope. It is a glycoside and a xylose derivative. It derives from a beta-D-xylose.
