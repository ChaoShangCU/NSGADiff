The molecule is a member of the class of tetramic acids that is trichosetin in which the hydrogen attached to the lactam nitrogen has been replaced by a methyl group. It is produced by the filamentous fungus Fusarium heterosporum. It has a role as an antibacterial agent, a quorum sensing inhibitor, a HIV-1 integrase inhibitor and a fungal metabolite. It is an enol, a member of octahydronaphthalenes, a primary alcohol and a member of tetramic acids. It derives from a trichosetin. It is a conjugate acid of an equisetin(1-).
