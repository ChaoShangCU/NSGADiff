The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of chenodeoxycholic acid with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucuronic acid. It has a role as a human urinary metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, a steroid glucosiduronic acid and an O-acyl carbohydrate. It derives from a chenodeoxycholic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a chenodeoxycholic acid 24-O-(beta-D-glucuronide)(1-).
