The molecule is a flavone C-glycoside that is luteolin substituted by a 2'-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1''->2')-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 6. It has been isolated from the leaves and roots of Petrorhagia velutina. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a flavone C-glycoside, a tetrahydroxyflavone and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from a luteolin.
