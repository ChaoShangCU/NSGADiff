The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-chlorobenzoic acid with the amino group of 2-[4-(2-aminoethyl)phenoxy]-2-methylpropanoic acid. Benafibrate is used for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and an antilipemic drug. It is a monocarboxylic acid, an aromatic ether, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from a propionic acid.
