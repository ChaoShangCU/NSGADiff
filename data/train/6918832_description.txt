The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that consists of quercetin attached to a (2'',3''-digalloyl)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Euphorbia lunulata, it exhibits insulin-like activity. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-galactoside, a gallate ester and a quercetin O-glycoside.
