The molecule is an amino oligosaccharide that is an undecaasaccharide derivative in which two alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)-[N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)]-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl chains are linked (1->3) and (1->6) to D-galactose. It is an amino oligosaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
