The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone and a flavone C-glycoside that is (S)-naringenin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage and a alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 8. It has been isolated from the roots and leaves of Petrorhagia velutina. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a flavone C-glycoside, a dihydroxyflavone and a (2S)-flavan-4-one. It derives from a (S)-naringenin.
