The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is lanost-8-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 24 and 25 , a carboxylic acid at position 21 and an oxo grouo at position 3 (the 24S stereoisomer). Isolated from the fruit bodies of Fomitopsis pinicola, it exhibits antiinflammatory activity against cylooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2). It has a role as a metabolite, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor and a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, an oxo monocarboxylic acid and a diol. It derives from a hydride of a lanostane.
