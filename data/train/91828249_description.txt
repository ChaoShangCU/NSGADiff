The molecule is a branched amino octasaccharide comprising a linear pentasaccharide chain of N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and D-glucose residues linked sequentially (2->6), (1->4), (1->6) and (1->4), to the galactose residue nearer to the reducing end is also linked (1->3) a linear alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl trisaccharide unit. It is an amino octasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
