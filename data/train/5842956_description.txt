The molecule is a dinitrile that is succinonitrile in which the methylene hydrogens at positions 2 and 3 are substituted by amino(phenylsulfanyl)methylidene groups. It acts as an inhibitor of MEK (mitogen activated protein kinase kinase). It has a role as a protein kinase inhibitor. It is a dinitrile, an enamine and an aryl sulfide. It derives from a hydride of a buta-1,3-diene.
