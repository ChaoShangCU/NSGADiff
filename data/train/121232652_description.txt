The molecule is a guaiacyl lignin that is scopoletin in which the phenolic hydrogen is replaced by a guaiacylglycerol group. It is found in Arabidopsis thaliana. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a guaiacyl lignin, a member of coumarins, a primary alcohol and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a scopoletin and a guaiacylglycerol.
