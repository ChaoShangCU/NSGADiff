The molecule is a glycoside that consists of an alpha-D-mannose residue and three N-formyl-alpha-D-perosamine residues linked sequentially (1->2), (1->3) and (1->2) and linked at the reducing end glycosidically to a 5-(methoxycarbonyl)pentyl group. It is a methyl ester, a glycoside and a tetrasaccharide derivative.
