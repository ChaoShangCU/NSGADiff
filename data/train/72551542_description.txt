The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3R,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-hydroxydocosapentaenoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-hydroxydocosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
