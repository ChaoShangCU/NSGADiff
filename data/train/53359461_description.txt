The molecule is a monohydroxybenzoic acid that is benzoic acid substituted by a hydroxy group at position 6 and a 2-phenylethenyl group at position 2 which in turn is attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 4. It has been isolated from the roots of Scorzonera judaica. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a monohydroxybenzoic acid, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucoside.
