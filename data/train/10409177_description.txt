The molecule is a furanocoumarin that is 2,3-dihydrofuro[3,2-c]coumarin substituted by methoxy group at position 7, methyl group at positions 2 and 3 (relatively trans configuration) and a 4-methyl-5-(4-methyl-2-furyl)-3(E)-pentenyl moiety at position 2. Isolated from the roots of Ferula fukanensis, it inhibits production of nitric oxide (NO). It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is an aromatic ether, a member of furans, a sesquiterpenoid and a furanocoumarin.
