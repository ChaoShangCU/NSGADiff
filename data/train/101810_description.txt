The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-12-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 16, an oxo group at position 23 and a carboxy group at position 28 (the 3beta,16alpha stereoisomer). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and an aldehyde. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
