The molecule is a member of the class of dihydroisocoumarins that is hydrangenol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 8 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the roots of Scorzonera judaica. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a member of dihydroisocoumarins, a member of phenols, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a hydrangenol.
