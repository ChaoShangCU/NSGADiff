The molecule is a steroid alkaloid that is 5alpha-preg-16-ene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 4, a N,N-dimethylamino group at position 20 and a N-senecoylamino group at position 3 (the 3beta,4beta,20S stereoisomer). Isolated from Sarcococca hookeriana, it exhibits antileishmanial and antibacterial activities. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an antileishmanial agent, an antibacterial agent and a plant metabolite. It is a steroid alkaloid, a secondary alcohol, an enamide and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a 3-methylbut-2-enoic acid. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-pregnane.
