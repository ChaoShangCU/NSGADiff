The molecule is an optically active form of allysine having L-configuration. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an allysine, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and an aminoadipate semialdehyde. It is a tautomer of a L-allysine zwitterion.
