The molecule is an enamide obtained by the formal condensation of ferulic acid with 2-(4-butylphenyl)ethanamine. It is isolated from Cuscuta reflexa and displays strong inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20). It has a role as an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is an enamide, a member of guaiacols and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a ferulic acid.
