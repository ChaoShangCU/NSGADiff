The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3R,23Z,26Z,29Z,32Z)-3-hydroxyoctatriacontatetraenoic acid. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R,23Z,26Z,29Z,32Z)-3-hydroxyoctatriacontatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
