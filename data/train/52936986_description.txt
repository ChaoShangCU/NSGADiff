The molecule is a N-acylamino acid that is L-histidine acylated at the nitrogen atom of the amino group by a (6-bromo-1H-indol-3-yl)acetyl residue. Isolated from the venom of the sea anemone Bunodosoma cangicum, it exhibits analgesic activity. It has a role as an analgesic and a marine metabolite. It is a member of indoles, an organobromine compound, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a L-histidine derivative.
