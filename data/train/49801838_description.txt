The molecule is a carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 5-(p-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 3-phenoxyazetidine and in which the phenoxy group has been substituted at the para- position by a 2-oxa-6-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-ylmethyl group. It is a melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHr1) antagonist. It has a role as a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor antagonist. It is an azaspiro compound, an oxaspiro compound, an oxadiazole, a N-acylazetidine, a member of oxetanes, an aromatic ether and a carboxamide. It is a conjugate base of an AZD1979(1+).
