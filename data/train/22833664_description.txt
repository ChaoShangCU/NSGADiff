The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-oxooctadecanoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a coenzyme A and a 3-oxooctadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-oxooctadecanoyl-CoA(4-).
