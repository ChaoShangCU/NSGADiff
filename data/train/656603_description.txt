The molecule is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of hydroxy(diphenyl)acetic acid with the hydroxy group of (3-endo,8-syn)-8-(2-fluoroethyl)-3-hydroxy-8-methyl-8-azoniabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. Its bromide salt is used as a drug for the treatment asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist, an anti-asthmatic drug and an antispasmodic drug. It is a carboxylic ester, a quaternary ammonium ion, a tertiary alcohol, an azabicycloalkane and an organofluorine compound.
