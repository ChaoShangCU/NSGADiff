The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of alpha-D-mannopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-D-Manp-(1->3)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc and an alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
