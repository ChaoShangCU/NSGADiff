The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 4',5,7-trihydroxy-3-methoxyflavone attached to a 6-O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the whole plant of Lepisorus contortus. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a disaccharide derivative, a glycosyloxyflavone, a dihydroxyflavone and a monomethoxyflavone.
