The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of beta-D-galactopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucoypranose and D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->6) glycosidic bonds. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-Galp and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
