The molecule is a para-terphenyl that consists of 1,4-diphenylbenzene substituted by acetyloxy group at position 3', hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 4'' a (3-hydroxybutanoyl)oxy group at position 6' and [3-(acetyloxy)butanoyl]oxy groups at positions 2' and 5' respectively. It is isolated from the fruit body of the mushroom Paxillus curtisii and exhibits radical scavenging activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is an acetate ester, a member of phenols and a para-terphenyl. It derives from a 3-hydroxybutyric acid. It derives from a hydride of a 1,4-diphenylbenzene.
