The molecule is the organophosphate oxoanion formed by proton loss from each of the phospho groups of 4-O-[4-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosylphospho)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosylphospho]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosyl 3-aminopropyl phosphate. It is a conjugate base of a trihydrogen 4-O-[4-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosylphospho)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosylphospho]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosyl 3-aminopropyl phosphate.
