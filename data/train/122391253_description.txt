The molecule is a class I yanuthone that is yanuthone E in which the sesquiterpenoid double bond furthest from the epoxycyclohexenone ring has undergone formal addition of water to give the corresponding tertiary alcohol. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a class I yanuthone, a tertiary alcohol, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, a secondary alcohol and a triol. It derives from a yanuthone E and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid.
