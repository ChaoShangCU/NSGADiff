The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside in which a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue is attached at position 4' of 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone via a glycosidic linkage. It derives from a 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone. It is a conjugate acid of a 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxychalcone 4'-O-beta-D-glucoside(1-).
