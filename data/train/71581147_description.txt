The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (R)-3-hydroxyhexanoic acid. It is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a hexanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (R)-3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA(4-).
