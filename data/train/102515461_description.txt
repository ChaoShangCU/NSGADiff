The molecule is a steroid acid resulting from the formal oxidation of the formyl group of 4alpha-formyl-ergosta-7,24(28)-dien-3beta-ol to the corresponding carboxylic acid. It derives from a 4alpha-formyl-ergosta-7,24(28)-dien-3beta-ol. It is a conjugate acid of a 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-ergosta-7,24(28)-diene-4alpha-carboxylate.
