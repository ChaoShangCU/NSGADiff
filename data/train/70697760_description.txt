The molecule is a labdane diterpenoid that is labda-8(17),14-diene substituted by a (R)-hydroxy group at position 13 and an alpha-hydroperoxy group at position 7. Isolated from the aerial parts of Aster spathulifolius, it exhibits moderate cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a labdane diterpenoid, a peroxol and a tertiary alcohol.
