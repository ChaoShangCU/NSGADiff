The molecule is an organosulfate oxoanion that is the conjugate base of (3Z,6Z,9Z)-dodeca-3,6,9-trien-1-yl hydrogen sulfate. Isolated from Daphnia pulex, it induces morphological changes of phytoplankton Scenedesmus gutwinskii. It has a role as a Daphnia pulex metabolite and a kairomone. It is a conjugate base of a (3Z,6Z,9Z)-dodeca-3,6,9-trien-1-yl hydrogen sulfate.
