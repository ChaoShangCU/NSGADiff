The molecule is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-3-cis-5-octadienoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a (3E,5Z)-dienoyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-3-cis-5-octadienoyl-CoA(4-).
