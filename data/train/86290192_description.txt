The molecule is a pyrimidine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate that is CMP in which the 2-keto group on the cytosine ring is replaced by an epsilon-L-lysyl residue. It is a pyrimidine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate, a member of cytidines, a L-lysine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a lysidine and a cytidine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a lysidine monophosphate(1-).
