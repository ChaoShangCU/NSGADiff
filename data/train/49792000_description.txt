The molecule is an organosulfate oxoanion that is a trianion arising from deprotonation of the O-sulfo, N-sulfo and carboxy groups of 3-D-glucuronosyl-N(2),6-disulfo-beta-D-glucosamine; major species at pH 7.3. It is an organosulfate oxoanion, an organic sulfamate oxoanion and a monocarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a 3-D-glucuronosyl-N(2),6-disulfo-beta-D-glucosamine.
