The molecule is a prostanoid-LPC that is the ammonium betaine of a 2-(prostaglandin H2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine arising from deprotonation of the phosphate OH group; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a secondary allylic alcohol and a prostanoid. It derives from a prostaglandin H2.
