The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 1-(N,N-dimethylglycyl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 5-{[(5-tert-butyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)methyl]sulfanyl}-1,3-thiazol-2-amine. It is a CDKL5 and CDK16 kinase inhibitor. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a N-acylpiperidine, an organic sulfide, a tertiary amino compound, a secondary carboxamide and a member of 1,3-oxazoles.
