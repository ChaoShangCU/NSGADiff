The molecule is a 3-oxoacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 4-isopropenyl-2-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is an acyl-CoA and a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a cyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA.
