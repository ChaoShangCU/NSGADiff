The molecule is a hydrochloride salt resulting from the reaction of equimolar amounts of dexverapamil and hydrogen chloride. It competitively inhibits the multidrug resistance efflux pump P-glycoprotein (MDR-1, EC 3.6.3.44), thereby potentially increasing the effectiveness of a wide range of antineoplastic drugs which are inactivated by MDR-1 mechanisms. Dexverapamil hydrochloride exhibits lower calcium antagonistic activity and toxicity than racemic verapamil hydrochloride. It has a role as an EC 3.6.3.44 (xenobiotic-transporting ATPase) inhibitor. It contains a dexverapamil(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (S)-verapamil hydrochloride.
