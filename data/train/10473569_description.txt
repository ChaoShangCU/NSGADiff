The molecule is a lignan that consists of 7,8-dihydronaphthalen-2-ol substituted by a 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl group at position 8, hydroxymethyl groups at positions 6 and 7 and a methoxy group at position 3 (the 7R,8S stereoisomer). Isolated from Vitex negundo, it exhibits inhibitory activity against lipoxygenase. It has a role as a lipoxygenase inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a lignan, a polyphenol, a primary alcohol and a member of guaiacols.
