The molecule is a diterpene glycoside that is labd-14-en-11-one substituted by beta-acetoxy groups at positions 6 and 7, an epoxy group between positions 8 and 13 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 1 (the 1alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from the whole plant of Coleus forskohlii, it shows relaxative effects on isolated guinea pig tracheal spirals in vitro. It has a role as a metabolite and a muscle relaxant. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an acetate ester, a cyclic ether, a cyclic ketone, a diterpene glycoside and a labdane diterpenoid.
