The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that consists of isorhamnetin substituted by a alpha-L-(6''''-p-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1->2)-rhamnopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Ginkgo biloba, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a cinnamate ester, a disaccharide derivative, a trihydroxyflavone and a monomethoxyflavone. It derives from an isorhamnetin and a trans-4-coumaric acid.
