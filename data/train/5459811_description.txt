The molecule is a 2,3-epoxysqualene in which the chiral centre has S configuration. It is converted into lanosterol by lanosterol synthase (EC 5.4.99.7) in a key rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of chloesterol, steroid hormones, and vitamin D. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a hydride of a squalene.
