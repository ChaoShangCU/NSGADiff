The molecule is a lipooligosaccharide consisting of a phenolic phthiocerol core linked to the trisaccharide 3,6-di-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-2,3-di-O-methyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-3-O-methyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranose. It has a role as an epitope. It derives from a phenolic phthiocerol.
