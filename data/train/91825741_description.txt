The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 2-methyl-3-oxopalmitic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA and a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-methyl-3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA(4-).
