The molecule is an N-acyl-O-(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-L-serine obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of hexadecanoic acid with the amino group of 1-octadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine It derives from a 1-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine. It is a conjugate acid of a N-hexadecanoyl-O-(1-octadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-L-serine(2-).
