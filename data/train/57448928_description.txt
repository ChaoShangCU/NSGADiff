The molecule is a benzothiazolium ion resulting from the methylation of the nitrogen of the benzothiazole group of N-[4-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-ylmethylene)-1-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinolin-2-yl]-N',N'-dimethyl-N-propylpropane-1,3-diamine. A cationic unsymmetrical cyanine dye that binds to double-stranded DNA and is used as a nucleic acid stain in molecular biology. It has a role as a fluorescent dye. It is a cyanine dye, a tertiary amine, a member of quinolines and a benzothiazolium ion.
