The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide in which a galactose residue is linked beta(1->3) to the residue at the reducing end of a linear chain of two galactose residues, one N-acetylglucosamine residue and one N-acetylgalactosamine residue, sequentially linked alpha(1->4), beta(1->4) and beta(1->6). It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
