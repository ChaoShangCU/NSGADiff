The molecule is a mannotetrose comprising beta-D-mannopyranose, beta-D-mannopyranose, alpha-D-mannopyranose and D-mannopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->2) glycosidic linkages. It derives from a beta-D-Manp-(1->2)-beta-D-Manp-(1->2)-alpha-D-Manp and a beta-D-Manp-(1->2)-alpha-D-Manp-(1->2)-D-Manp.
