The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a member of n-3 PUFA and a product of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
