The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3E,5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosapentaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3E,5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
