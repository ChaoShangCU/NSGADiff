The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is (3beta,16alphaalpha)-13,28-epoxyoleanane-3,16,30-triol with a beta-D-Glcp-(1->2)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)]-alpha-L-Arap moiety attached to position 3 by a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from Ardisia japonica and exhibits anticancer properties. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a bridged compound, a cyclic ether, a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a secondary alcohol, a trisaccharide derivative and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a (3beta,16alpha)-13,28-epoxyoleanane-3,16,30-triol. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
