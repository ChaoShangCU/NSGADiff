The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is apigenin substituted kaempferol in which the hydroxyl hydrogen at position 3 is replaced by a beta-D-xylosyl residue It has a role as a metabolite. It is a monosaccharide derivative, a glycosyloxyflavone and a trihydroxyflavone. It derives from a kaempferol. It is a conjugate acid of a kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-xyloside(1-).
