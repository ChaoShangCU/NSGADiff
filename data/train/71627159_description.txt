The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z)-triacontahexaenoyl-CoA. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a very long-chain acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z)-triacontahexaenoyl-CoA.
