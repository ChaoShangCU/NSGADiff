The molecule is a trisaccharide that is alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->3)-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the galactopyranose ring has been converted into the corresponding beta-L-fucopyranosyl derivative. It derives from a beta-L-Fucp-(1->4)-D-Galp and an alpha-D-Glcp-(1->3)-D-Galp.
