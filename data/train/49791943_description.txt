The molecule is a high molecular weight copolymer of diethylenetriamine and epichlorohydrin (hydrochloride), with approximately 1 out of 5 amine nitrogens protonated. Due to the highly cross-linked and insoluble nature of the material, no structural formula has been assigned and no specific molecular weight information is available. A basic anion exchange resin, it is used as its hydrochloride for binding bile acids in the intestine, inhibiting their reabsorption. It has a role as an anticholesteremic drug. It is a copolymer macromolecule and a polyamine macromolecule.
