The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by the formal condensation of the terminal amino group of 3-amino-L-alanine with the carboxy group of (2E)-4-methoxy-4-oxobut-2-enoic acid. It has a role as a metabolite. It is an enoate ester, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a methyl ester. It derives from a 3-amino-L-alanine.
