The molecule is a synthetic dihydroxyflavone that is 5,7-dihydroxyflavone which is substituted by a 3-hydroxy-1-methylpiperidin-4-yl group at position 8 and by a chlorine at the 2' position (the (-)-3S,4R stereoisomer). A cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitor, it has been studied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia, arthritis and atherosclerotic plaque formation. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor, an antirheumatic drug and an apoptosis inducer. It is a dihydroxyflavone, a hydroxypiperidine, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a tertiary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of an alvocidib(1+).
