The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that is quercetin substituted by a alpha-6'''-caffeoylglucosyl-beta-1,2-rhamnosyl residue at position 3 via glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Sedum sarmentosum, it exhibits inhibitory activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor. It is a disaccharide derivative, a cinnamate ester and a quercetin O-glycoside. It derives from a trans-caffeic acid.
