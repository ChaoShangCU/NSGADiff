The molecule is a class II yanuthone that is 5,6-epoxy-cyclohex-2-en-1-one which is substituted at positions 3, 4, and 6 by methoxy, hydroxy, and trans,trans-farnesyl groups, respectively (the 4S,5R,6R stereoisomer). Isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger, it shows antifungal activity towards the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (IC50 = 51.7 +-4.7 muM). It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite and an antifungal agent. It is a class II yanuthone, an enol ether and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a (2-trans,6-trans)-farnesol.
