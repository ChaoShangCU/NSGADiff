The molecule is a monosaccharide derivative that is beta-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 1 is substituted by a [(2S)-2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H-furo[3,2-g][1]benzopyran-9-yl]oxy group. It is a natural product found in several plant species including Ruta graveolens and Citropsis articulata. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antiplasmodial drug and an antibacterial agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a member of psoralens.
