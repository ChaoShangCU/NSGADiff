The molecule is enalapril in which the ethyl ester group has been hydrolysed to the corresponding carboxylic acid. Enalaprilat is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and is used (often in the form of its prodrug, enalapril) in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, for reduction of proteinuria and renal disease in patients with nephropathies, and for the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death in high-risk patients. Unlike enalapril, enalaprilat is not absorbed by mouth but is given by intravenous injection, usually as the dihydrate. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and an antihypertensive agent. It is a dicarboxylic acid and a dipeptide.
