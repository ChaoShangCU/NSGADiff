The molecule is a spirostanyl glycoside that is (3beta,5alpha,6alpha,25S)-spirostan-3,6,27-triol attached to a 6-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Yucca smalliana, it exhibits antifungal activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antifungal agent. It is a spirostanyl glycoside, a disaccharide derivative, a 6alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 27-hydroxy steroid, an oxaspiro compound and an organic heterohexacyclic compound. It derives from a hydride of a (25S)-5alpha-spirostan.
