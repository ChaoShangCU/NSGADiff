The molecule is a cinnamate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of cis-caffeic acid with one of the hydroxy groups of meso-tartaric acid. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a cinnamate ester, a dicarboxylic acid, a tetraric acid derivative and a member of catechols. It derives from a meso-tartaric acid and a cis-caffeic acid.
