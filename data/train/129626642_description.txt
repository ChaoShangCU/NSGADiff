The molecule is a docosanoid anion obtained by deprotonation of the two carboxy groups and protonation of the glutamyl alpha-amino group of (13R)-S-cysteinylglycinyl-(14S)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a (13R)-S-cysteinyl-(14S)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid.
