The molecule is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA obtained from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxyisopentadecanoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-hydroxyisopentadecanoyl-CoA(4-).
