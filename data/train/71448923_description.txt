The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z)-3-oxotetracosapentaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z)-tetracosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z)-3-oxotetracosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
