The molecule is a viscumneoside that is homoeriodictyol in which the hydroxy groups at the 7 and 4' positions have been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranoside and beta-D-apiofuranoside derivatives, respectively. Found in Viscum coloratum, an evergreen hemiparasitic plant whose stems and leaves are used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatism. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a flavanone glycoside, a beta-D-glucoside and a viscumneoside. It derives from a homoeriodictyol and a beta-D-apiose.
