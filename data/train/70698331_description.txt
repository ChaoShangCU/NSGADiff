The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide consisting of the tetrasaccharide beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine having an alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl residue attached at the 3-position of the galactosyl residue at the non-reducing end and an alpha-L-fucosyl residue attached at the 3-position of the N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl residue at the reducing end. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
