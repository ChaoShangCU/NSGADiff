The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is zerumbone substituted by a hydroxy group at position 5. Isolated from the rhizomes Zingiber zerumbet, it has been found to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a cyclic ketone, a sesquiterpenoid and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a zerumbone. It derives from a hydride of a humulane.
