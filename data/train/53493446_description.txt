The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is oleana-11,13(18)-diene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 23 and a carboxy group at position 28 (the 3alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from the leaves and twigs of Fatsia polycarpa, it exhibits antibacterial and anti-HBV activities. It has a role as a metabolite, an anti-HBV agent, an antibacterial agent and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
