The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 7-fluoro-3-[(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)amino]furo[3,2-c]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid with the amino group of (2S)-1-(aminooxy)propan-2-ol. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.24 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a furopyridine, an organofluorine compound, an organoiodine compound, an aromatic amine, a secondary amino compound, a secondary alcohol and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
