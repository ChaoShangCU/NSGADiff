The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2,2'-bipyridine substituted by a methoxy group at position 4 and a (Z)-(hydroxyimino)methyl group at position 6. It has been isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus. It has a role as a marine metabolite and a bacterial metabolite. It is an aromatic ether, an aldoxime, a member of bipyridines and a pyridine alkaloid. It derives from a hydride of a 2,2'-bipyridine.
