The molecule is a benzochromene that is benzo[c]chromen-6-one which is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 1, 4 and 7, methoxy groups at positions 3 and 9, a methyl group at position 1, and a 2-carboxy-2-hydroxyethyl group at position 4, and in which the carboxy group has undergone condensation with the 4-hydroxy group to afford the corresponding spirocyclic lactone. It is active against the pathogenic bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas lachrymans, Ralstonia solanacearum, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, and Xanthomonas vesicatoria, with MIC values in the range 25-100 mug/mL. It has a role as an antifungal agent and a fungal metabolite. It is an oxaspiro compound, a benzochromene, a secondary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol and a gamma-lactone.
