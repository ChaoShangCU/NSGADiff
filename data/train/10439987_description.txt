The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is 13,30-cyclodammarane-3,7,23,24,25-pentol esterified to the corresponding acetate at position 3 and attached to a 6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Dysoxylum cumingianum, it exhibits antileukemic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, an acetate ester, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a secondary alcohol.
