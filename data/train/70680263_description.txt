The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is 4,4a,7,8,8a,9-hexahydronaphtho[2,3-b]furan substituted by methyl groups at positions 3, 5 and 8a and an oxo group at position 9 (the 4aS,8aS stereoisomer). It is isolated from the methanol extract of the whole plant of Chloranthus japonicus and acts as a chitin synthase inhibitor. CJ-01 also shows antifungal activity against various human and phytophathogenic fungi. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 2.4.1.16 (chitin synthase) inhibitor and an antifungal agent. It is a sesquiterpenoid, an enone, a cyclic ether, an organic heterotricyclic compound, an aromatic ketone and a cyclic terpene ketone.
