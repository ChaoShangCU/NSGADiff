The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) resulting from the removal of all four protons from the phosphate and diphosphate groups of 3-hydroxy-9-oxo-9,10-seco-23,24-bisnorchola-1,3,5(10)-trien-22-oyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a 3-hydroxy-9-oxo-9,10-seco-23,24-bisnorchola-1,3,5(10)-trien-22-oyl-CoA.
