The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is myricetin in which the hydroxy groups at the 3 and 4' positions have been glycosylated by an alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-6-O-[(2E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl group and a 4-O-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-beta-D-xylopyranose group, respectively. It derives from a myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside](1-). It is a conjugate acid of a montbretin A(1-).
