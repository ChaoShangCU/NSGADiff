The molecule is a carboxylic ester obtained by the formal condensation of the benzylic hydroxy group of 4-hydroxy-6-[hydroxy(phenyl)methyl]-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid with 3-methylbutanoic acid. It is isolated from the culture broth of Penicillium sp. SPF-32629 and acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme chymase (EC 3.4.21.39). It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an EC 3.4.21.39 (chymase) inhibitor and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a carboxylic ester, a pyridone, a monohydroxypyridine and a monocarboxylic acid.
