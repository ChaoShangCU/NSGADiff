The molecule is a chlorophenylethane that is 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-diphenylethane substituted by additional chloro substituents at positions 4 of the phenyl substituents. It is a commonly used organochlorine insecticide. It has a role as a bridged diphenyl acaricide, a carcinogenic agent, a persistent organic pollutant and an endocrine disruptor. It is an organochlorine insecticide, a benzenoid aromatic compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a chlorophenylethane. It derives from a 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-diphenylethane and a 4,4'-dichlorodiphenylmethane.
