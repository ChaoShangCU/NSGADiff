The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-12-ene substituted by carboxy groups at positions 23 and 28 and hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 16 ( the 3beta,16alpha stereoisomer). It has a role as a metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a hydroxy carboxylic acid and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
