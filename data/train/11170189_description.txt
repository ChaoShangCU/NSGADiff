The molecule is a methyl glycoside that is beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc in which the anomeric hydroxy group is replaced by a beta-methoxy. It is a methyl glycoside, a tetrasaccharide derivative and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc.
