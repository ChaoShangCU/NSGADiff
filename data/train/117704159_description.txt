The molecule is a homoisoflavonoid that is cremastranone in which the phenolic hydroxy of the 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl group has undergone formal esterification with N-Boc-L-phenylalanine and in which both of the remaining hydroxy groups have undergone O-methylation. It has a role as a pharmaceutical and an angiogenesis inhibitor. It is a homoisoflavonoid, a carbamate ester, a L-phenylalanine derivative, an aromatic ether and a semisynthetic derivative. It derives from a cremastranone.
