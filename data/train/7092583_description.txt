The molecule is a labdane diterpenoid that is labdane which has been hydroxylated at position 5 of the decalin ring and in which the 3-methylpentyl substituent (also at position 5 of the decalin ring) has been dehydrogenated to introduce a trans double bond at the 3-4 position and hydroxylated at position 5. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a labdane diterpenoid, a tertiary alcohol, a carbobicyclic compound and a primary allylic alcohol. It derives from a hydride of a labdane.
