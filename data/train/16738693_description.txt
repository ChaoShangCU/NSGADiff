The molecule is the monohydrate form of ipratropium bromide. An anticholinergic drug, ipratropium bromide blocks the muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the smooth muscles of the bronchi in the lungs. This opens the bronchi, so providing relief in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute asthma. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist and a bronchodilator agent. It contains an ipratropium bromide.
