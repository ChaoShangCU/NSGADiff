The molecule is a hydroperoxyicosatrienoate that is the conjugate base of (8R,9E,11Z,14Z)-8-hydroperoxyicosatrienoic acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a hydroperoxyicosatrienoate and a long-chain fatty acid anion. It derives from an all-cis-icosa-8,11,14-trienoate. It is a conjugate base of an (8R,9E,11Z,14Z)-8-hydroperoxyicosatrienoic acid.
