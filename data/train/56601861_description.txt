The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is 3,16-dihydroxy-13,28-epoxyoleanane-21,22-diyl diacetate attached to a tetrasaccharide residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is an acetate ester, a cyclic ether, a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a secondary alcohol, a tetrasaccharide derivative and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
