The molecule is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of (1-hydroxycyclopentyl)(phenyl)acetic acid with N,N-dimethylethanolamine. A tertiary amine antimuscarinic with actions similar to atropine, it is used as its hydrochloride salt to produce mydriasis (excessive dilation of the pupil) and cycloplegia (paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye) for opthalmic diagnostic procedures. It acts more quickly than atropine and has a shorter duration of action. It has a role as a mydriatic agent, a parasympatholytic, a muscarinic antagonist and a diagnostic agent. It is a carboxylic ester, a tertiary amino compound and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a (1-hydroxycyclopentyl)phenylacetic acid and a N,N-dimethylethanolamine.
