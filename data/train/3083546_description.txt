The molecule is an ethyl ester resulting from the formal condesnation of the carboxy group of flufenpyr with ethanol. It is used as a contact herbicide for the control of broad-leaved weeds. It acts as a protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor, causing protoporphyrins to accumulate, damaging the membrane structure and cellular function. No longer approved for use in the European Union. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical and an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor. It is an ethyl ester, an aromatic ether, a pyridazinone, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It derives from a flufenpyr.
