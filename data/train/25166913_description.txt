The molecule is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is 1H-benzimidazole which is substituted by a (2R,4S)-4-{[(4-cyanophenyl)carbamoyl]amino}-1-methylpiperidin-2-yl group at position 2. It is a hedgehog signalling pathway inhibitor that acts by binding to Smoothened (SMO) receptors and blocking signal transduction (IC50 = 5 nM). It is used in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adult patients (aged >= 75 years), or who have medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy. It has a role as a SMO receptor antagonist, a Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of benzimidazoles, a member of piperidines, a member of phenylureas and a nitrile.
