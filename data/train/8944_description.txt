The molecule is a piperidinecarboxylate ester that is the ethyl ester of isonipecotic acid in which the hydrogen alpha- to the carboxyl group is substituted by a phenyl group, and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen is substituted by a 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl group. It has a role as an opioid analgesic and an opioid receptor agonist. It is a piperidinecarboxylate ester, a substituted aniline and an ethyl ester. It derives from a N-[2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl]-4-phenylisonipecotic acid. It is a conjugate base of an anileridine(2+).
