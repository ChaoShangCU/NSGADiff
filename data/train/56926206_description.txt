The molecule is a withanolide saponin that consists of 22,26-epoxyergosta-5,24-dien-28-ol substituted by additional hydroxy groups at positions 1, 3 and 19, an oxo group at position 26 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 28 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Physalis longifolia. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a delta-lactone, a 1-hydroxy steroid, a 19-hydroxy steroid, a beta-D-glucoside, an ergostanoid, a monosaccharide derivative, a withanolide saponin and a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid.
