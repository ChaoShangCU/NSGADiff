The molecule is a branched oligosacharide consisting of a tetrasaccharide chain of deamino-alpha-neuraminyl (KDN), beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (2->3), (1->3) and (1->3), to the reducing-end N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue of which is also linked (2->6) a single KDN or a (2->8)-linked chain of KDN residues, the number of KDN residues in the chain ranging between 1 and 9, with an average of 3. The diagram shows the structure with 3 KDN residues in the side-chain.
