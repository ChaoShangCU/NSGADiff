The molecule is a lipopeptide that contains N-methylphenylalanine and lysine as the amino acid residues linked to a dec-9-enoyl moiety via an amide linkage (the R,R stereoisomer). It is isolated from the deep sea sponge Aaptos ciliata and exhibits antileishmanial activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antileishmanial agent. It is a member of caprolactams and a lipopeptide. It derives from a dec-9-enoic acid.
