The molecule is a gallate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of gallic acid with the (3'R)-hydroxy group of (-)-epicatechin-(4alpha->8)-(-)-epicatechin. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a gallate ester, a proanthocyanidin, a polyphenol and a biflavonoid. It derives from a (-)-epicatechin-(4alpha->8)-(-)-epicatechin and a gallic acid.
