The molecule is a diterpenoid obtained by hydroxylation of one of the terminal methyl groups of (2E,6E,10E)-geranylgeranic acid. It is a diterpenoid, an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, a methyl-branched fatty acid, a trienoic fatty acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It derives from a (2E,6E,10E)-geranylgeranic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,6E,10E,14E)-omega-hydroxygeranylgeranate.
