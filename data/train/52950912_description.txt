The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is urs-12-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 22, an oxo group at position 28 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 28. It has been isolated from the leaves and twigs of Juglans sinensis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a carboxylic ester, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
