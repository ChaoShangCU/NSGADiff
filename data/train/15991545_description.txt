The molecule is a (2S)-2-methylacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2S)-2-methyltetradecanoic acid. It is a (2R)-2-methylacyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2S)-2-methyltetradecanoyl-CoA(4-).
