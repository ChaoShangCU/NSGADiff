The molecule is an epoxide which is a carboxamide obtained by the formal condensation of one of the carboxy groups of oxirane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid with N-{4-[(3-aminopropyl)amino]butyl}-L-phenylalaninamide. It is a natural product, isolated from Gliocladium sp. F-2665. TMC-52D acts as an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, particularly cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1), cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15), and papain (EC 3.4.22.2), with IC50 values of 280 nM, 6 nM, and 49 nM, respectively. The epoxide group has trans configuration but its exact stereochemistry is uncertain: it is either (2R,3R) or (2S,3S). It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, a cathepsin B inhibitor, a cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) inhibitor, an EC 3.4.22.2 (papain) inhibitor and a fungal metabolite. It is an epoxide, a monocarboxylic acid, a primary amino compound, a secondary amino compound and a dicarboxylic acid monoamide.
