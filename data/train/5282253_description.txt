The molecule is an L-proline derivative produced by the diatomic algal genus of Pseudo-nitzschia and other related species that is L-proline substituted by a carboxymethyl group at position 3 and a 6-carboxyhepta-2,4-dien-2-yl group at position 4. It is an analogue of kainic acid and is the neurotoxin associated with amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). It has a role as a neurotoxin, a marine metabolite, a hapten and a neuromuscular agent. It is a pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid, a tricarboxylic acid, a L-proline derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid.
