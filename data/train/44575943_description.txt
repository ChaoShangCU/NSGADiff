The molecule is a steroid saponin that is 3,7,16-trihydroxyergosta-5,24(28)-diene substituted by a 4-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-alpha-L-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage (the 3beta,7beta,16beta stereoisomer). Isolated from Sinularia crispa, it exhibits spermatostatic activity. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a steroid saponin, an acetate ester, an ergostanoid, a monosaccharide derivative, a secondary alcohol, a 16beta-hydroxy steroid and a 7beta-hydroxy steroid.
