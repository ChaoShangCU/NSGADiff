The molecule is a primary aliphatic amine that is the 3,5-dimethyl derivative of 1-aminoadamantane. A low to moderate affinity uncompetitive (open-channel); NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. It has a role as a dopaminergic agent, an antiparkinson drug, a NMDA receptor antagonist, a neuroprotective agent and an antidepressant. It is a member of adamantanes and a primary aliphatic amine. It is a conjugate base of a memantinium(1+). It derives from a hydride of an adamantane.
