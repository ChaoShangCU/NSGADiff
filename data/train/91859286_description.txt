The molecule is an aminotrisaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 6 have been glycosylated by a beta-D-galactopyranosyl group and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group, respectively. It is an amino sugar, an amino trisaccharide, a member of acetamides, a beta-D-glucoside and a beta-D-galactoside. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc and a beta-D-Glcp-(1->6)-D-GlcpNAc.
