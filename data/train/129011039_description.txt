The molecule is a beta-D-galactoside that is the 4-[2-(4-sulfanylbutanamido)ethyl]phenyl glycoside of a disaccharide consisting of a 3-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucuronic acid residue linked (1->3) to beta-D-galactose. It is a beta-D-galactoside and a disaccharide derivative. It is a conjugate acid of a beta-D-GlcA3S-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-OC6H4-4-[CH2]2NHC(O)[CH2]3SH(2-).
