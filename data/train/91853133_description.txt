The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of D-mannopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4 have been converted into the corresponding alpha-D-mannopyranosyl and 2-acetamino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl derivatives, respectively. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-D-Manp and an alpha-D-Manp-(1->3)-D-Manp.
