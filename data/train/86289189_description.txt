The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z)-hexacosapentaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z)-hexacosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z)-hexacosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
