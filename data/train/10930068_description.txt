The molecule is a monosaccharide derivative that is eriodictyol attached to a (6''-O-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a member of 3'-hydroxyflavanones, a trihydroxyflavanone, a gallate ester, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from an eriodictyol.
