The molecule is an organic salt resulting from the formal condensation of equimolar amounts of quinclorac and dimethylamine. It is used as a (rather persistent) herbicide for the post-emergence control of weeds in rice, grass and turf. It is not approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as an agrochemical, a herbicide and a synthetic auxin. It contains a quinclorac(1-) and a dimethylaminium.
