The molecule is a flavone C-glycoside that is acacetin substituted by an alpha-rhamnosyl-(1->2)-beta-glucopyranosyl residue at position 8 via a C-glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from Fortunella japonica and Fortunella margarita. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a flavone C-glycoside, a disaccharide derivative, a dihydroxyflavone and a monomethoxyflavone. It derives from a 5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone.
