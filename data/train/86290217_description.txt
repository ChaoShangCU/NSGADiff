The molecule is an acyl-CoA resulting from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-[(3aS,4S,5R,7aS)-5-hydroxy-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydroinden-4-yl]propanoic acid. It derives from a 3-[(3aS,4S,5R,7aS)-5-hydroxy-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydroinden-4-yl]propanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-[(3aS,4S,5R,7aS)-5-hydroxy-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydroinden-4-yl]propanoyl-CoA(4-).
