The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the phosphate to the amino group of 2-[(5Z,13E,15S)-11alpha,15-dihydroxy-9-oxoprosta-5,13-dien-1-oyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; major species at pH 7.3. It is a tautomer of a 2-[(5Z,13E,15S)-11alpha,15-dihydroxy-9-oxoprosta-5,13-dien-1-oyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
