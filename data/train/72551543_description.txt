The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3R,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-3-hydroxytetracosapentaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-3-hydroxytetracosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
