The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2,2'-bipyridine-6-carboxamide substituted by methoxy groups at position 4 and carbamoyl nitrogen respectively. Isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is an aromatic ether, a pyridinecarboxamide, a member of bipyridines and a pyridine alkaloid. It derives from a hydride of a 2,2'-bipyridine.
