The molecule is a mannopentaose comprised of alpha-D-mannose and beta-D-mannose residues linked (1->6), to the alpha-D-mannose residue of which are linked (1->3) and (1->6) two further alpha-D-mannose residues, while to the beta-D-mannose residue is (1->3)-linked a fourth alpha-D-mannose. It has a role as an epitope.
