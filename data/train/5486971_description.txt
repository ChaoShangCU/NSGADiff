The molecule is a gamma-amino acid that is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) carrying an isobutyl substitutent at the beta-position (the S-enantiomer). Binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. It has a role as an anticonvulsant and a calcium channel blocker. It derives from a gamma-aminobutyric acid.
