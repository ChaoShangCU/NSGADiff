The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucoopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->2) and (1->3) glycosidic linkages and in which the hydroxy group at position 6 of the acetamidogalactopyranose moiety has been glycosylated by a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(3-O-sulfo-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a member of acetamides and an oligosaccharide sulfate. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp3S-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)]-D-GalpNAc.
