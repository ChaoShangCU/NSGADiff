The molecule is a tricyclic triterpenoid that is 3,4-seco-lanosta-8,24-diene-26,22-olide 3-methylester substituted by an acetoxy group at position 19 and a hydroxy group at position 4. It is isolated from the fruiting bodies of the Vietnamese mushroom Ganoderma colossum and displays inhibitory activity towards the enzyme HIV protease. It has a role as a HIV protease inhibitor and a fungal metabolite. It is an acetate ester, a tertiary alcohol, a tricyclic triterpenoid, a delta-lactone and a methyl ester.
