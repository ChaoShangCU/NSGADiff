The molecule is a hydroxy fatty amide ascaroside obtained by obtained by formal condensation of the 24-hydroxy group of (24R)-24-hydroxy-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-3-oxopentacosanamide with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a hydroxy fatty amide ascaroside, a N-acylethanolamine and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
