The molecule is an acetate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the primary hydroxy group of fludrocortisone with acetic acid. A synthetic corticosteroid, it has glucocorticoid actions about 10 times as potent as hydrocortisone, while its mineralocorticoid actions are over 100 times as potent. It is used in partial replacement therapy for primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease and for the treatment of salt-losing adrenal hyperplasia. It is an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, an acetate ester, a mineralocorticoid, a 20-oxo steroid, a fluorinated steroid and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a fludrocortisone.
