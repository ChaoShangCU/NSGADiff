The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2,2'-bipyridine substituted by a hydroxy group at position 4 and an (acetylamino)methyl group at position 6. Isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is a member of bipyridines, a monohydroxypyridine, a pyridine alkaloid and a member of acetamides. It derives from a hydride of a 2,2'-bipyridine.
