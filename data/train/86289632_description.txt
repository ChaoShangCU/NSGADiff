The molecule is a polysaccharide derivative comprised of a [2)-alpha-L-Rhap(III)-(1->2)-alpha-L-Rhap(II)-(1->3)-alpha-L-Rhap(I)-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->] tetrasaccharide repeat modified by the (1->4) linkage of an alpha-D-glucosyl group to the GlcNAc residue and by addition of acetyl groups to O-2 of 80% of the Rha(I) residues and to either O-3 or O-4 of many of the Rha(III) residues (70% to O-3; 15% to O-4). The structure provided is representative of that in Shigella flexneri serotype 1b and shows the most common repeating unit. It has a role as an antigen.
