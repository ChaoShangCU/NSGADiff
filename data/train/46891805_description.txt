The molecule is a 3-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine in which the phosphatidyl acyl groups at positions 1 and 2 are specified as octadecanoyl and (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl respectively. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid and a hexadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine(1-).
