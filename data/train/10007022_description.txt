The molecule is a iridoid monoterpenoid isolated from the aerial parts of Verbena litoralis and shown to possess stimulating effects on nerve growth factor. It has a role as a metabolite and a nerve growth factor stimulator. It is an iridoid monoterpenoid, a monoterpene glycoside, a cinnamate ester, a gamma-lactone and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a trans-caffeic acid.
