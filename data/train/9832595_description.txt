The molecule is a seven amino acid oligopeptide fragment of the human milk protein, beta-casein. It is an inhibitor of pancreatic elastase, 5-HT2-serotonin receptors, mu-opioid receptors and delta-opioid receptors. It has a role as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist, a delta-opioid receptor antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, a human metabolite and an EC 3.4.21.36 (pancreatic elastase) inhibitor. It is a conjugate acid of a beta-casomorphin-7 (human)(1-).
