The molecule is a secondary carboxamide that is anthranilic acid in which the carboxy group has undergone condensation with the primary amino group of alpha-amino-epsilon-caprolactam, while the aryl-amino group has undergone condensation with the carboxy group of 1-benzothiophene-2-carboxylic acid. It is a selective, non-competitive antagonist of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB, also known as tyrosine receptor kinase B). It has a role as a tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor antagonist, an antidepressant and an anxiolytic drug. It is a secondary carboxamide, a member of caprolactams and a member of 1-benzothiophenes. It derives from a 2-aminohexano-6-lactam and an anthranilic acid.
