The molecule is a branched octasaccharide derivative comprising one 5-deoxy-5-(methylsulfanyl)xylofuranose, one mannopyranose and six D-arabinofuranose units, in an assembly consisting of two of the arabinose residues linked alpha(1->5), with beta-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl and 5-deoxy-5-(methylsulfanyl)-beta-xylofuranosyl-(1->4)-alpha-mannosyl-(1->5)-beta-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl units linked to respectively the 3- and 5-positions of the arabinose residue distal from the reducing-end residue.
