The molecule is a lysophosphatidylcholine 22:5 in which the acyl group at position 1 is (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosapentaenoyl and the hydroxy group at position 2 is unsubstituted. It is a lysophosphatidylcholine (22:5/0:0) and a 1-O-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. It derives from a (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosa-4,7,10,13,16-pentaenoic acid.
