The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid that is acetic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens is replaced by a 4-isobutylphenyl group. Although it was shown to be effective in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the clinical use of ibufenac was discontinued due to hepatotoxic side-effects. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, a hepatotoxic agent and an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor. It derives from an acetic acid.
