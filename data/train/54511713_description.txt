The molecule is a nucleoside monophosphate analogue that is 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate in which the hydrogen at position 5 on the uracil ring is replaced by a carboxy group. It has a role as a Mycoplasma genitalium metabolite. It is a nucleoside monophosphate analogue, an aromatic carboxylic acid and a pyrimidine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It derives from a dUMP.
