The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 7-methyl-3-oxooct-6-enoic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from a 7-methyl-3-oxooctanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 7-methyl-3-oxooct-6-enoyl-CoA(4-).
