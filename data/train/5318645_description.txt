The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is isorhamnetin substituted at position 3 by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a monosaccharide derivative, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone, a trihydroxyflavone and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from an isorhamnetin and a beta-D-glucose.
