The molecule is a pyrimidinecarboxamide that is nicotinamide in which one of the hydrogens attached to the carboxamide nitrogen is replaced by a 2-(nitrooxy)ethyl group. It has both nitrate-like and ATP-sensitive potassium channel activator properties, and is used for the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris. It has a role as a vasodilator agent and a potassium channel opener. It is a pyridinecarboxamide and a nitrate ester. It derives from a nicotinamide.
