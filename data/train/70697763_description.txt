The molecule is a steroid saponin that is 3,16,17-trihydroxycholest-5-en-22-one attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a 2-O-acetyl-3-O-[2-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 16 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Ornithogalum thyrsoides, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a steroid saponin, a cholestanoid, a benzoate ester, an acetate ester and a 17-hydroxy steroid. It derives from a 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid.
