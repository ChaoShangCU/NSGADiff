The molecule is a steroid glycoside that is 3,8,12,14,17-pentahydroxypregn-5-en-20-one esterified at position 12 by (2E)-3,4-dimethylpent-2-enoic acid and glycosylated at the 3beta-hydroxy group by beta-cymaropyranose (the 3beta,12beta,14beta,17alpha stereoisomer). It is isolated from the roots of Cynanchum auriculatum and displays antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a methyl ketone, a deoxy hexoside, a tertiary alcohol, an enoate ester, a steroid saponin and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane.
