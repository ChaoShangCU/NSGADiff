The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of p-[(trifluoromethyl)sulfanyl]benzoic acid with the amino group of (2S)-2-amino-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile in which the hydroxy group has been converted to the corresponding 5-cyano-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl ether. A broad-spectrum nematicide, it is used to control gastrointestinal roundworms in sheep and goats. It has a role as an anthelminthic drug and a nematicide. It is a nitrile, an aryl sulfide, an aromatic ether, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a secondary carboxamide.
