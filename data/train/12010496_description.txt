The molecule is 2,2(1)-Dihydrobenzo[b]porphyrin-13,17-dipropanoic acid substituted by carboxy groups at positions 2(1) and 2(2), an ethenyl group at position 8, and methyl groups at positions 2, 7, 12 and 18 (the 2R,2(1)S-enantiomer). It is a tetracarboxylic acid and a beta-substituted porphyrin. It is an enantiomer of a (2S,2(1)R)-2(1),2(2)-dicarboxy-8-ethenyl-2,7,12,18-tetramethyl-2,2(1)-dihydrobenzo[b]porphyrin-13,17-dipropanoic acid.
