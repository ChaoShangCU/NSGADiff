The molecule is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is L-aspartic acid substituted at position 3 by a methylthio group. It is a sulfur-containing amino acid, a L-aspartic acid derivative, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid, an amino dicarboxylic acid, a C4-dicarboxylic acid and a methyl sulfide. It derives from a 3-thio-L-aspartic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-methylthioaspartate(1-).
