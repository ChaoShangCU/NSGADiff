The molecule is the amide resulting from the formal condensation of 4-[(biphenyl-2-ylcarbonyl)amino]benzoic acid with the benzazepine nitrogen of 2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d][1]benzazepine. It is an antagonist for two of the three types of arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors, V1a and V2. It is used as its hydrochloride salt for the treatment of hyponatraemia (low blood sodium levels) caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). It has a role as a vasopressin receptor antagonist.
