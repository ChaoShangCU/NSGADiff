The molecule is a ring assembly that consists of robinetinidol attached to a gallocatechin unit resulting in a bond between C-4 of the pyran ring and C-8 of the benzopyran ring. It is isolated from Acacia mearnsii. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a catechin and a ring assembly. It derives from a robinetinidol and a gallocatechin.
