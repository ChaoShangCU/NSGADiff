The molecule is an aminoacridine that is acridine that is substituted by amino groups at positions 3 and 6. A slow-acting bacteriostat that is effective against many Gram-positive bacteria (but ineffective against spores), its salts were formerly used for treatment of burns and infected wounds. It has a role as an antiseptic drug, a carcinogenic agent, an antibacterial agent, a chromophore and an intercalator. It is a conjugate base of a 3,6-diaminoacridine(1+).
