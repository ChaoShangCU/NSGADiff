The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising a linear tetrasaccharide chain of N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine residues linked (1->3), (1->4) and (1->3) respectively, with an alpha-L-fucose residue linked (1->2) to the galactose residue. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
