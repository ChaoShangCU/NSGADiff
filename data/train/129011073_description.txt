The molecule is a cholestanoid that is lathosterol in which the double bond at position 7,8 has been oxidised to the corresponding epoxide (the 7alpha,8alpha stereoisomer). It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a cholestanoid, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid and an epoxy steroid. It derives from a 5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol.
