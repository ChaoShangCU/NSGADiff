The molecule is a sulfone resulting from the oxidation of the sulfur attached to one of the phenyl groups of GW 501516. It is a urinary metabolite of GW 501516 (a failed drug candidate and gene doping agent whose use by athletes has been prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency), so detection of the sulfone in sports drugs testing can be used to prove GW 501516 doping. It is a sulfone, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an aromatic ether, a monocarboxylic acid and an organofluorine compound. It derives from a GW 501516 sulfoxide and a GW 501516.
