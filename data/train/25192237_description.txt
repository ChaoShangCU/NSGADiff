The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2,2'-bipyridine substituted at position 6 by a hydroxymethyl group and at position 4 by a methoxy group. Isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is a member of bipyridines, a pyridine alkaloid, a monohydroxypyridine and an aromatic ether. It derives from a hydride of a 2,2'-bipyridine.
