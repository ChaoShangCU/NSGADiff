The molecule is a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 2-hydroxy-4-isopropenylcyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from a cyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA and a 2-hydroxy-4-isopropenylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid.
