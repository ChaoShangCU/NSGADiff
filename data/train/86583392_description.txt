The molecule is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid that is pyruvic acid in which two of the methyl hydrogens are replaced by a 5-hydroxy-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-ylidene group (the 1R,5R,6S stereoisomer). It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid, a secondary alcohol, an epoxide, an enone and an oxabicycloalkane. It derives from a pyruvic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (3E)-3-[(1R,5R,6S)-5-hydroxy-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-ylidene]pyruvate.
