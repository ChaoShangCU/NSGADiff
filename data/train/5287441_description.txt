The molecule is a pyochelin that has R-stereochemistry at the thioaminal centre; the diastereoisomer with S-stereochemistry at this centre is pyochelin II. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a mixture of pyochelin I (major) and pyochelin II (minor) via condensation of salicylic acid and two molecules of cysteine. The enantiomeric compounds, enant-pyochelin I and II, are produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens.
