The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising two galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetylglucosaminyl units linked beta(1->3) and beta(1->6) to an alpha-D-galactose residue; beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)]-D-GalpNAc with alpha configuration at the reducing-end anomeric centre. It has a role as an epitope.
