The molecule is a branched pentasaccharide consisting of alpha-L-rhamnose, alpha-D-galactose, alpha-D-mannose and alpha-L-rhamnose residues linked sequentially (1->3), (1->2) and (1->4), to the the mannose residue of which is also linked (1->3) an alpha-D-abequose residue; epitope of the O-antigen polysaccharide in Salmonella. It has a role as an epitope.
