The molecule is an amino disaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been converted to the corresponding D-galactopyranoside. The stereochemistry at the anomeric position in each of the galactopyranose rings is not stated. It is a partially-defined glycan, an amino disaccharide, a member of acetamides and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
