The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoyl-CoA. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-) and a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoyl derivative. It is a conjugate base of a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoyl-CoA.
