The molecule is an organofluorine compound that consists of 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one bearing an N-3-fluoro-4-(morpholin-4-yl)phenyl group as well as an acetamidomethyl group at position 5. A synthetic antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to a site on 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit and prevents further formation of a functional 70S initiation complex. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and a protein synthesis inhibitor. It is an oxazolidinone, a member of morpholines, an organofluorine compound and a member of acetamides.
