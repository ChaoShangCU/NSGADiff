The molecule is a member of the class of neuraminic acids that is neuraminic acid attached in sequence to beta-D-galactopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl, beta-D-galactopyranosyl, and beta-D-glucopyranosyl, residues by (2->3), (1->3), (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic linkages. The galactosyl residue attached to the neuraminic acid is glycosylated at position 4 by a beta-D-acetamidogalactosyl residue, while the other galactosiyl residue has been glycosylated at position 4 by a beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->3)-2-acetamido-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue. It is a member of neuraminic acids and an octasaccharide derivative. It derives from a beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->4)-[beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->4)-[alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->3)]-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)]-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp.
