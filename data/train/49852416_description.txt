The molecule is an organosulfate oxoanion that is the conjugate base of N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->6)-[6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, arising from deprotonation of the sulfate OH group. It is a conjugate base of a N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->6)-[6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine.
