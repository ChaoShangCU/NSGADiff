The molecule is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A in which the allylic methyl group of residue 1 [(2S,3R,4R,6E)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)oct-6-enoic acid] has been oxidised to the corresponding carboxylic acid. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M17.
