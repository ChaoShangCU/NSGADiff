The molecule is a phenyl sulfate oxoanion obtained by deprotonation of the sulfo and carboxy groups of caffeic acid 3-sulfate; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite, a human urinary metabolite and a human blood serum metabolite. It is a phenyl sulfate oxoanion and an unsaturated fatty acid anion. It derives from a trans-caffeic acid. It is a conjugate base of a caffeic acid 3-sulfate.
