The molecule is a branched pentasaccharide consisting of a D-GlcNAc residue at the reducing end with an alpha-D-Man-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Man-(1->6)]-beta-D-Man-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc moiety attached via a beta-(1->4) linkage. It has a role as a carbohydrate allergen. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a paucimannose N-glycan.
