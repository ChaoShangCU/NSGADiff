The molecule is an enamide obtained by the formal condensation of 4-methoxyphenylethylamine with trans-caffeic acid. It is isolated from Cuscuta reflexa and displays strong inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20). It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor. It is an enamide, a member of catechols, a monomethoxybenzene and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a trans-caffeic acid and a 4-methoxyphenylethylamine.
