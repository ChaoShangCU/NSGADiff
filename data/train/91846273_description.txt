The molecule is an aminotrisaccharide consisting of beta-D-galactopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl and alpha-L-fucopyranosyl residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
