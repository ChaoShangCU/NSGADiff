The molecule is a viscumneoside that is rhamnacine (3',7-dimethylquercetin) in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucoside and in which the hydroxy group at position 6 of the glucosyl moiety has been acylated by formal condensatio with the pro-R carboxy group of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a viscumneoside, a glycosyloxyflavone, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, a tertiary alcohol and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid and a rhamnacene.
