The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of aristolochic acid with the hydroxy group of (1R,2Z,6E,10E)-3-formyl-7,11-dimethylcyclododeca-2,6,10-trien-1-ol. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an aromatic ester, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a C-nitro compound, a cyclic acetal, an aromatic ether, an enal, a macrocycle and a sesquiterpenoid. It derives from an aristolochic acid.
