The molecule is an enamide resulting from the formal condensation of (2Z)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acrylic acid with the amino group of morpholine. The agricultural fungicide dimethomorph is a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-dimethomorph; only the Z isomer has fungicidal activity. It is an aromatic ether, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a morpholine fungicide, a tertiary carboxamide and an enamide.
