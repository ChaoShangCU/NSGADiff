The molecule is an icosanoid that is leukotriene E4 in which two methylene groups are removed from the carboxyalkyl chain attached to the non-conjugated double bond. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a tricarboxylic acid, a L-cysteine thioether, an icosanoid, a secondary alcohol and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a leukotriene E4.
