The molecule is a member of the class xanthones which consists of a dihydroxanthone skeleton substituted by a acetyloxy group at position 4, a hydroxy group at position 8, a methyl group at position 6 and a methoxycarbonyl group at position 4a (the 4R,4aS stereoisomer). It is isolated from Penicillium and exhibits potent antitumour activity against both human and murine tumour cell lines. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimicrobial agent and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a diester, a member of xanthones, a member of phenols, an acetate ester and a methyl ester.
