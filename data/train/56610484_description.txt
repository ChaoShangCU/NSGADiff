The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid that is 17alpha-estradiol in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 17 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It is a steroid glucosiduronic acid, a 3-hydroxy steroid, a member of phenols and a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid. It derives from a 17alpha-estradiol. It is a conjugate acid of a 17alpha-estradiol 17-O-(beta-D-glucuronide)(1-).
