The molecule is a flavone C-glycoside that is luteolin attached to a disaccharide residue at position 6. It has been isolated from natural product Petrorhagia velutina and Zea mays and exhibits insecticidal and neuroprotective activities. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an insecticide and a neuroprotective agent. It is a flavone C-glycoside, a disaccharide derivative, a tetrahydroxyflavone and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a luteolin.
