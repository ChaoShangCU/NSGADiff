The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide that is N-[2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl]propanamide substituted by a hydroxyimino group at position 2 and a 3-bromo-4-methoxyphenyl group at position 3. A bromotyrosine derivative isolated from the marine sponge Verongula gigantea, it exhibits histamine-H3 antagonist activity. It has a role as an animal metabolite, a marine metabolite and a H3-receptor antagonist. It is a ketoxime, a monomethoxybenzene, a member of bromobenzenes, a member of imidazoles and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
