The molecule is a ring assembly that is a dimer obtained by coupling between 1,5,8-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-9H-xanthen-9-one and C-glycosylated 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone. Isolated from Swertia franchetiana, it exhibits anti-HIV activity. It has a role as a metabolite, a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an EC 6.5.1.1 [DNA ligase (ATP)] inhibitor. It is a member of xanthones, a tetrahydroxyflavone, a C-glycosyl compound and a biaryl.
