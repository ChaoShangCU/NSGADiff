The molecule is an oxo dicarboxylic acid that is but-2-enedioic acid substituted by an amino group at position 2 and a 3-oxoprop-1-enyl group at position 3. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is an amino dicarboxylic acid, an oxo dicarboxylic acid, a muconic semialdehyde and a non-proteinogenic alpha-amino acid. It derives from a butenedioic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-amino-3-(3-oxoprop-1-enyl)but-2-enedioate and a 2-ammonio-3-(3-oxoprop-1-enyl)but-2-enedioate(1-).
