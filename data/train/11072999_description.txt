The molecule is a quercetin O-glucoside in which a 4''-O-caffeoyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety is attached respectively via a glycosidic linkage to positions 3 and 7 of quercetin. It is isolated from the aerial parts of Putoria calabrica and exhibits radical scavenging activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a quercetin O-glucoside, a cinnamate ester and a member of catechols. It derives from a trans-caffeic acid.
