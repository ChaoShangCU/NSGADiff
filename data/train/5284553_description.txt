The molecule is erythritol in which each of the hydroxy groups has been converted to the corresponding nitrate ester. It is a vasodilator with properties similar to nitroglycerin. It is usually used diluted with lactose or other suitable inert excipients, in order to minimise the risk of explosion; undiluted erythrityl tetranitrate can be exploded by percussion or excessive heat. It has a role as a vasodilator agent and an explosive. It derives from an erythritol.
