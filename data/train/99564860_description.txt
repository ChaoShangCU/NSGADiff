The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid that is epitestosterone in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 17 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It is a 3-oxo steroid, a steroid glucosiduronic acid, an enone and a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid. It derives from an epitestosterone. It is a conjugate acid of an epitestosterone 17-O-(beta-D-glucuronide)(1-).
