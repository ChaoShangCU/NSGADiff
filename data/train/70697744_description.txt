The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is bisabola-2,10-diene substituted by a peroxy group between positions 2 and 10 (the 1S,4R,6R stereoisomer). Isolated from Artemisia stolonifera and Eupatorium rufescens, it exhibits antineoplastic and antiplasmodial activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and an antiplasmodial drug. It is an organic peroxide and a sesquiterpenoid. It derives from a hydride of a bisabolane.
