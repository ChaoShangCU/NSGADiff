The molecule is a mannooligosaccharide derivative that is alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 3 of the mannopyranosyl residue attached to the acetamidoglucose moiety has been glycosylated by an alpha-D-mannopyranosyl group. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a member of acetamides and a mannooligosaccharide derivative.
