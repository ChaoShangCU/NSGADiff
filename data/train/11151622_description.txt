The molecule is a member of the class of cinnamamides that is an enamide obtained by the formal condensation of the amino group of (R)-octopamine with the carboxy group of ferulic acid. Isolated from Pisonia aculeata, it exhibits antitubercular activity. It has a role as a metabolite, a plant metabolite and an antitubercular agent. It is a member of cinnamamides, a member of phenols, a monomethoxybenzene and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a (R)-octopamine and a ferulic acid.
