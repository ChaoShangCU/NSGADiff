The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4 have been converted to the corresponding beta-D-galactopyranosyl and 4,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-xylo-hexopyranosyl derivatives, respectively. It is a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
