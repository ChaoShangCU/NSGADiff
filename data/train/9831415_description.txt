The molecule is a long-chain fatty acid ethyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoic acid with the hydroxy group of ethanol. It has a role as an anticholesteremic drug, a marine metabolite, an antipsychotic agent, an antidepressant and a prodrug. It is a long-chain fatty acid ethyl ester and a polyunsaturated fatty ester. It derives from an all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoic acid.
