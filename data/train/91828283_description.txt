The molecule is a cholestanoid resulting from the oxidation of (25R)-3beta,26-dihydroxycholest-5-en-7-one to the corresponding carboxylic acid. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a 3beta-sterol, a 7-oxo steroid, a cholestanoid, an oxysterol, a steroid acid, a monocarboxylic acid and a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid. It derives from a cholesterol. It is a conjugate acid of a (25R)-3beta-hydroxycholest-5-en-7-one-26-oate.
