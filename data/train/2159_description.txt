The molecule is a member of the class of benzamides resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-amino-5-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methoxybenzoic acid with the primary amino group of 2-(aminomethyl)-1-ethylpyrrolidine. It is a potent, selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It is an atypical antipsychotic/antischizophrenic agent with limited extrapyrimidal side effects. It has a role as a second generation antipsychotic, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of pyrrolidines, an aromatic amine, a sulfone, a member of benzamides and an aromatic amide.
