The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide comprising a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine disaccharide, to the galactosyl residue of which are (1->3)- and (1->6)-linked two N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
