The molecule is a steroid alkaloid that is 5alpha-pregn-2-ene-4-one substituted by a N-formylamino group at position 3 and a N,N-dimethylamino group at position 20. Isolated from Sarcococca hookeriana, it exhibits antiplasmodial activity and inhibitory activity against cholinesterase. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and an antiplasmodial drug. It is a steroid alkaloid, a member of formamides and an enone. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-pregnane.
