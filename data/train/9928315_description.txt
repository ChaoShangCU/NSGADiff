The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoamide obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxylic group of oxirane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid with the amino group of N-(4-aminobutyl)-L-phenylalaninamide (the 2S,3S stereoisomer). An antibiotic isolated from the fermentation broth of Penicillium citrinum, it acts as a potent inhibitor of cysteine protease. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, a cysteine protease inhibitor and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a primary amino compound, an epoxide and a dicarboxylic acid monoamide.
