The molecule is a guaiacyl lignin that is ferulic acid in which the phenolic hydrogen is replaced by a sulfoguaiacylglycerol group. It is found in Arabidopsis thaliana. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a guaiacyl lignin, a monomethoxybenzene, a primary alcohol, a secondary alcohol, an aryl sulfate and a methoxycinnamic acid. It derives from a guaiacylglycerol and a ferulic acid.
