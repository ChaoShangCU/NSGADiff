The molecule is a cholestanoid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (25R)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid with the amino group of taurine. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a cholestanoid, a 3alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 7alpha-hydroxy steroid, a monocarboxylic acid amide and an organosulfonic acid. It derives from a (25R)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid and a taurine.
