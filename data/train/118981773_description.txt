The molecule is an alpha-D-glucoside that is the 2-aminoethyl glycoside of a tetrasaccharide consisting of two beta-D-glucosyl residues, an alpha-D-glucosyl residue and (at the reducing end) an alpha-D-galactosyl residue, all linked sequentially (1->4). It is an alpha-D-galactoside and a tetrasaccharide derivative.
