The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is urs-12-ene carrying a carboxy substituent at position 28 as well as five hydroxy substituents at positions 2, 3, 19, 23 and 24 (the 2alpha,3beta stereoisomer). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a pentol. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
