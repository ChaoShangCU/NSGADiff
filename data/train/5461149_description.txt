The molecule is a myo-inositol cyclic phosphate that is 1D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate having an alpha-D-glucosaminyl residue attached at the 6-position. It has a role as an epitope. It is a monosaccharide derivative, a myo-inositol cyclic phosphate and a D-glucosaminide. It is a tautomer of a 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate zwitterion.
