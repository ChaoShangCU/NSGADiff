The molecule is an O-acyl carbohydrate consisting of 6-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranose attached to a 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl and a galloyl group at positions 1 and 3 respectively. Isolated from Symplocos racemosa, it exhibits inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.4.21.1 (chymotrypsin) inhibitor. It is an O-acyl carbohydrate, a disaccharide derivative, a gallate ester and a member of methoxybenzenes.
