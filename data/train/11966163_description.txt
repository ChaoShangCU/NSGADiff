The molecule is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyric acid. It has a role as a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an isobutyryl-CoA and a (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA(4-).
