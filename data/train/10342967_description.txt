The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (+)-taxifolin substituted by a beta-D-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-D-arabinopyranoside, a member of 3'-hydroxyflavanones, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a tetrahydroxyflavanone and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from a beta-D-arabinopyranose and a (+)-taxifolin.
