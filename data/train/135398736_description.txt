The molecule is a synthetic monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic (monobactam), used primarily to treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. It inhibits mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thereby blocking peptidoglycan crosslinking. It has a role as a drug allergen, an EC 2.4.1.129 (peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase) inhibitor and an antibacterial drug. It is a beta-lactam antibiotic allergen and a monobactam.
