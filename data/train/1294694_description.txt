The molecule is a benzoate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of vanillic acid with the hydroxy group of (-)-borneol. A metabolite isolated from Ferula dissecta. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an animal metabolite, an antimicrobial agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a benzoate ester, a monoterpenoid, a phenol, a monomethoxybenzene and a carbobicyclic compound. It derives from a (-)-borneol and a vanillic acid.
