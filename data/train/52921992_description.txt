The molecule is a docosanoid that is (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying a hydroperoxy substituent at position 17S. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,17S,19Z)-17-hydroperoxydocosahexaenoate.
