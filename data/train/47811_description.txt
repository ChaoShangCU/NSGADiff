The molecule is a diamine that is ergoline in which the beta-hydrogen at position 8 is replaced by a (methylthio)methyl group and the hydrogen attached to the piperidine nitrogen (position 6) is replaced by a propyl group. A dopamine D2 receptor agonist which also has D1 and D2 agonist properties, it is used as the mesylate salt in the management of Parkinson's disease, although it was withdrawn from the U.S. and Canadian markets in 2007 due to an increased risk of cardiac valve dysfunction. It has a role as an antiparkinson drug and a dopamine agonist. It is a diamine, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a methyl sulfide. It is a conjugate base of a pergolide(1+).
