The molecule is a ring assembly that is phenoxyacetic acid in which the phenyl group has been substituted at position 2 by chlorine, position 4 by fluorine, and position 5 by a 5-methyl-6-oxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazin-1(6H)-yl group. Its esters, particularly the ethyl ester (flufenpyr-ethyl), are used as contact herbicides for the control of broad-leaved weeds. It has a role as a herbicide and an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor. It is a monocarboxylic acid, an aromatic ether, a pyridazinone, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a member of monochlorobenzenes.
