The molecule is a kaempferol O-glucoside that is the decaacetate ester derivative of paeonoside. Isolated from the aerial parts of Delphinium staphisagria, it exhibits trypanocidal activity. It has a role as a metabolite, a trypanocidal drug and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an acetate ester and a kaempferol O-glucoside. It derives from a kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside.
