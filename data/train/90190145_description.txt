The molecule is a hydroxy fatty-acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid. It is a 2-hydroxy-3-methylacyl-CoA, a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA(4-).
