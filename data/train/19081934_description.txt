The molecule is a hydrochloride salt obtained by mixing equimolar amounts of RS 39604 with hydrochloric acid. A potent and selective 5-HT4 antagonist, with a pKi of 9.1 at 5-HT4 receptors in guinea pig striatal membranes and greater than 1000-fold selectivity over 5-HT1A, 2C, 3 and D1, D2, M1, M2, AT1, B1 and alpha1C receptors. The ketone group gives RS 39604 a relatively long half life; it is also orally active and so suitable for in vivo studies. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist. It contains a RS 39604(1+).
