The molecule is an alk-2-enoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 4-methylpent-2-enoic acid. It is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an alk-2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-methylpent-2-enoyl-CoA(4-).
