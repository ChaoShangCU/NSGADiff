The molecule is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate in which the acyl substituents at positions 1 and 2 are specified as stearoyl and (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl respectively. It is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and a phosphatidic acid 40:6. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid and an octadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 1-stearoyl-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate(2-).
