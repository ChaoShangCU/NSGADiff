The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is tricin 7-O-glucoside with the hydroxy group on the glycosyl ring at position 6 replaced with a sinapoyl moiety. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a dihydroxyflavone, a dimethoxyflavone, a cinnamate ester, a monosaccharide derivative and a D-glucoside. It derives from a trans-sinapic acid and a tricin 7-O-glucoside.
