The molecule is a benzenetriol that is phenethylamine in which the hydrogens at positions 2, 4, and 5 on the phenyl ring are replaced by hydroxy groups. It occurs naturally in human urine, but is also produced as a metabolite of the drug DOPA (used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease). It has a role as a neurotoxin, a human metabolite and a drug metabolite. It is a primary amino compound, a benzenetriol and a catecholamine. It derives from a dopamine.
