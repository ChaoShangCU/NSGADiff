The molecule is a hydroxyflavanone with a pyranochromane skeleton that is 3,4,7,8-tetrahydro-2H,6H-pyrano[3,2-g]chromen-6-one substituted by geminal methyl groups at position 2, hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 5 and a phenyl group at position 8 which in turn is substituted by a geranyl group at position 2 and hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4. Isolated from Macaranga tanarius, it exhibits alleopathic effect. It has a role as an allelochemical and a plant metabolite. It is a hydroxyflavanone, a pyranochromane and an extended flavonoid.
