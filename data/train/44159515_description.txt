The molecule is a member of the class of oxindoles that is 7-hydroxy-2-oxindole-3-acetic acid in which the phenolic hydrogen has been replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as an Arabidopsis thaliana metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a member of oxindoles and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid.
