The molecule is a flavonoid oxoanion resulting from the deprotonation of the hydroxy group at positio 7 of the flavonoid moiety of myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside]. Identified in PMID: 23549747 Fig. S21 peak 4. It derives from a myricetin 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside](1-). It is a conjugate base of a myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside].
