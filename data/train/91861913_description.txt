The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-alpha-D-Manp in which the acetamidoglucopyranosyl moiety has been glycosylated at position 3 by an alpha-L-fucopyranosyl group. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-alpha-D-Manp and an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
