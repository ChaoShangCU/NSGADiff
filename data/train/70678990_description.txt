The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide comprised of a tetrasaccharide chain of beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl residues linked sequentially (1->3), (1->3) and (1->4), with an alpha-L-fucosyl residue linked (1->2) to the galactosyl residue proximal to the reducing-end glucosaminyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
