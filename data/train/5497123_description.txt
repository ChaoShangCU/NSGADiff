The molecule is a lipid hydroperoxide, obtained by the formal substitution of a hydrogen at position 9 of (9Z,11E,15Z)-octadeca-9,11,15-trienoic acid by a hydroperoxy group (the 13S-stereoisomer). Biochemically, it is an 18-C rearrangement and primary peroxidation product of alpha-linolenic acid, an intermediate in prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism, and the substrate of the lyase enzyme hydroperoxide dehydratase. It is a lipid hydroperoxide, a trienoic fatty acid and a hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid. It derives from a (9Z,11E,15Z)-octadeca-9,11,15-trienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,11E,13S,15Z)-13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate. It is an enantiomer of a (9Z,11E,13R,15Z)-13-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid.
