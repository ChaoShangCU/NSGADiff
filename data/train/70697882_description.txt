The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 5,3',4'-trihydroxyflavone substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 3 and a 2'',2''-dimethylpyrano ring fused across positions 7 and 8. Isolated from the leaves of Salix matsudana, it acts as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. It has a role as a metabolite and a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. It is an extended flavonoid, a glycosyloxyflavone, a trihydroxyflavone, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a pyranochromane.
