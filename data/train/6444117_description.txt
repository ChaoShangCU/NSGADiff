The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2-trans,4-cis)-deca-2,4-dienoic acid. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a (2E,4Z)-dienoyl-CoA. It derives from a coenzyme A. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,4Z)-deca-2,4-dienoyl-CoA(4-).
