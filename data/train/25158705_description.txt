The molecule is a member of the class of 4-pyridones that is aspernigrin A (2-benzyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide) in which the nitrogen of the carboxamide has been acylated by a (3S)-3-carboxybutanoyl group. It has been isolated from Aspergillus niger and several other Aspergillus species. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a dicarboximide, a monocarboxylic acid and a member of 4-pyridones. It derives from an aspernigrin A.
