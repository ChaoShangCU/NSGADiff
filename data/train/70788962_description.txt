The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide consisting of three repeating units of beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fuc-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcNAc joined by (1->3)-linkages with an alpha-L-fucosyl residue attached at the 2-position of the galactose residue at the non-reducing end. It has a role as an epitope. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an amino decasaccharide.
