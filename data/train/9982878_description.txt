The molecule is a 19-oxo steroid that is that is andrastin B in which the hydroxy group at position 19 has been oxidised to give the corresponding aldehyde. A farnesyltransferase inhibitor produced by Penicillium roqueforti, a filamentous fungus involved in the ripening of several kinds of blue cheeses. It has a role as an EC 2.5.1.58 (protein farnesyltransferase) inhibitor and a Penicillium metabolite. It is an acetate ester, a 5beta steroid, a 19-oxo steroid, a 15-hydroxy steroid, an enol, a 17-oxo steroid, a meroterpenoid, a methyl ester and a steroid aldehyde. It derives from an andrastin B. It is a conjugate acid of an andrastin A(1-).
