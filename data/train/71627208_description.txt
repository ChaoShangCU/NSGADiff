The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosatetraenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
