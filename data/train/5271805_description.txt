The molecule is a biflavonoid that is the 7,4'-dimethyl ether derivative of amentoflavone. Isolated from Ginkgo biloba and Dioon, it exhibits anti-HSV-1, antineoplastic and inhibitory activities towards arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase 2. It has a role as an anti-HSV-1 agent, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and a metabolite. It is a biflavonoid, a hydroxyflavone, a methoxyflavone and a ring assembly. It derives from an amentoflavone.
