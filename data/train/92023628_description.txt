The molecule is a rebaudioside that is rebaudioside A in which the the hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3 of the beta-D-glucosyl ester moiety have both been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucoside. Found in very low concentraitions in the leaves of Stevia Rebaudiana, it is more than 200 times sweeter than sucrose. It has a role as a sweetening agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a tetracyclic diterpenoid and a rebaudioside. It derives from a rebaudioside A, a rebaudioside D and a beta-D-Glcp-(1->2)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1->3)]-beta-D-Glcp.
