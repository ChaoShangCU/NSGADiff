The molecule is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid that is 3-O-acetyl-4'-O-demethylpapaveroxine in which the phenolic hydroxy group has been converted to the corresponding methyl ether. An intermediate in the biosynthesis of noscarpine in the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a cyclic acetal, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, an acetate ester, a member of benzaldehydes, an organic heterotricyclic compound, an aromatic ether and a tertiary amino compound. It derives from a 3-O-acetyl-4'-O-demethylpapaveroxine.
