The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is urs-12-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 1, 2, 3 and 23 and a carboxy group at position 28 (the 1beta,2alpha,3alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from Weigela subsessilis, it exhibits anticomplement activity against complement induced hemolysis. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a monocarboxylic acid and a tetrol. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
