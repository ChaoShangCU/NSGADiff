The molecule is a C-terminal boronic acid petide that is N-acetyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine in which the C-termnal carboxy group has been replaced by a borono (-B(OH)2) group. A thrombin (Factor IIa) inhibitor, thereby acting as an anticoagulant. It has a role as an EC 3.4.21.5 (thrombin) inhibitor and an anticoagulant. It is a C-terminal boronic acid peptide, a member of acetamides and a member of guanidines. It is a conjugate base of an Ac-(D)Phe-Pro-boroArg-OH(1+).
