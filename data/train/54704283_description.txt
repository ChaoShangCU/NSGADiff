The molecule is an aromatic ketone in which the ketone carbonyl group is attached to a (1R,2R,4aS,7S,8aR)-4,7-dimethyl-1-[(1E)-prop-1-en-1-yl]-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen-2-yl group and a 4-hydroxy-5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl group. Isolated from the from the "imperfect" fungus Cylindrocladium iliciola strain MFC-870. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent and a mitochondrial respiratory-chain inhibitor. It is a member of phenols, a pyridone, an aromatic ketone, a monohydroxypyridine, a carbobicyclic compound, a member of octahydronaphthalenes and an ilicicolin.
