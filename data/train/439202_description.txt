The molecule is a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid that is L-homoserine substituted at oxygen with a guanidino (carbamimidamido) group. Although structurally related to L-arginine, it is non-proteinogenic. It has a role as a phytogenic insecticide and a plant metabolite. It derives from a L-homoserine. It is a conjugate base of a L-canavanine(1+). It is a tautomer of a L-canavanine zwitterion.
