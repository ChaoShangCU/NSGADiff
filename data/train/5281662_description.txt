The molecule is a xanthone that is bellidifolin in which a beta-Dglucopyranosyl residue is attached at position O-8 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated particularly from Gentiana campestris and Gentiana germanica. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, an aromatic ether and a xanthone glycoside. It derives from a bellidifolin.
