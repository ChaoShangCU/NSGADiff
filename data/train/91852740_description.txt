The molecule is a glucosamine oligosaccharide comprising N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminosyl, beta-D-galactosyl, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(alpha-L-fucosyl)-beta-D-glucosyl, beta-D-galactosyl, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(alpha-L-fucosyl)-beta-D-glucosyl, beta-D-galactosyl, and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose joined together in sequence by (2->3), (1->4), (1->3), (1->4), (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic linkages, respectively. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a carbohydrate acid derivative. It derives from an alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc. It is a conjugate acid of an alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc(1-).
