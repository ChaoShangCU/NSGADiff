The molecule is a nickel coordination entity obtained by complexation of nickel(II) with pyridinium-3,5-bisthiocarboxylic acid mononucleotide. It has a role as a cofactor. It is a nickel coordination entity, a pyridine nucleotide and a nucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It derives from a nicotinic acid D-ribonucleotide. It is a conjugate acid of a Ni(II)-pyridinium-3,5-bisthiocarboxylate mononucleotide(1-).
