The molecule is a galactosiduronic acid resulting from the formal condensation of the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-galactopyranuronic acid with the phosphate group of ditrans,polycis-dodecaprenyl phosphate. It derives from a ditrans,polycis-dodecaprenyl phosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a ditrans,polycis-dodecaprenyl phosphate-GalA(2-).
