The molecule is an ent-kaurane diterpenoid that is ent-kaur-16-en-18-oic acid substituted by a beta-L-3',5'-diacetoxy-arabinofuranosyl moiety at position 18 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the whole herb of Sagittaria pygmaea and exhibits antibacterial activity against the oral pathogens. It has a role as a metabolite and an antibacterial agent. It is an acetate ester and an ent-kaurane diterpenoid. It derives from a beta-L-arabinofuranose.
