The molecule is a cardenolide glycoside in which the 3beta-hydroxy group of digitoxigenin carries a 2,6-dideoxy-beta-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1->4)-2,6-dideoxy-beta-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1->4)-2,6-dideoxy-beta-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl trisaccharide chain. It has a role as an EC 3.6.3.9 (Na(+)/K(+)-transporting ATPase) inhibitor. It derives from a digitoxigenin. It is a conjugate acid of a digitoxin(1-).
