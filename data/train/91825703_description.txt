The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprising a linear tetrasaccharide chain of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (1->3), (1->4) and (1->6), to the reducing-end N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue is also linked (1->3) an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl disaccharide unit. It is an amino hexasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
