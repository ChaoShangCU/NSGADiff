The molecule is an organofluorine compound that is 4-benzoylpyrazole in which the phenyl is substituted at position 3 by a (2,3-dihydroxypropyl)oxy group and in which the pyrazole moiety is substituted at positions 1 and 5 by a 4-fluorophenyl group and an amino group, respectively. It has a role as a protein kinase inhibitor. It is a benzoylpyrazole, an organofluorine compound, a primary amino compound and a member of propane-1,2-diols. It derives from a monofluorobenzene and a 4-benzoylpyrazole.
