The molecule is a quercetin O-glucoside in which quercetin is attached to a alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl group at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage while the hydroxy group at position 5 is replaced by a galloyl group. Isolated from the young leaves of Calycolpus warscewiczianus, it exhibits activity against a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. It has a role as a metabolite and an antiplasmodial drug. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a trihydroxyflavone, an alpha-L-arabinofuranoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a gallic acid.
