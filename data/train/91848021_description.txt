The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising a linear chain of alpha-sialyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl residues, linked (2->3), (1->4) and (1->3) respectively, with an alpha-L-fucosyl residue linked to the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp(1->4)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc.
