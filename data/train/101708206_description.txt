The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (5E)-tetradecenoic acid. It has a role as a rat metabolite. It is an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (5E)-tetradecenoyl-CoA(4-).
