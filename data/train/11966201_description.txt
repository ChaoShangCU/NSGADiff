The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-2-heptadecenoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA, an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-2-heptadecenoyl-CoA(4-).
