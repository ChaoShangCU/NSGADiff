The molecule is a multi-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxypristanic acid. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a multi-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a pristanoyl-CoA.
