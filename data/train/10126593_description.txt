The molecule is an oxalate salt obtained by reaction of 5-nonyloxytryptamine with one equivalent of oxalic acid. 5-HT1B selective agonist, several times more potent than sumatriptan and inactive as a 5-HT1A agonist (Ki at 5-HT1B = 1 nM, selectivity over 5-HT1A > 300-fold). It has a role as a serotonergic agonist. It contains a 5-nonyloxytryptaminium(1+).
