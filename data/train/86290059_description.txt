The molecule is a non-proteinogenic dipeptide formed from L-gamma-glutamic acid and hercynyl-L-selenocysteine residues. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It is an ammonium betaine, a dipeptide and a sulfoxide. It derives from a L-histidine. It is a conjugate acid of a N(alpha)-(L-gamma-glutamyl)-hercynyl-L-selenocysteine(1-).
