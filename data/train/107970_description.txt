The molecule is an aminodiol that consists of propane-1,3-diol having amino and 2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl substituents at the 2-position. It is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator used for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. A prodrug, fingolimod is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to active metabolite fingolimod-phosphate, a structural analogue of sphingosine 1-phosphate. It has a role as an immunosuppressive agent, a prodrug, an antineoplastic agent, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist and a CB1 receptor antagonist. It is an aminodiol and a primary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a fingolimod(1+).
