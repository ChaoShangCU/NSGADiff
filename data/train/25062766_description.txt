The molecule is a benzamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-{2-[4-(morpholin-4-yl)anilino]pyrimidin-4-yl}benzoic acid with the primary amino group of aminoacetonitrile. It is an ATP-competitive JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with IC50 of 11 nM and 18 nM, respectively. Used for the treatment of patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.2 (non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-anaemic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is an aminopyrimidine, a member of morpholines, a secondary amino compound, a tertiary amino compound, a member of benzamides and a nitrile.
