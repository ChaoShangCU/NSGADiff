The molecule is a steroid saponin that is 4-methylstigmasta-7,24(28)-diene-21-thioic S-acid attached to an alpha-L-quinovopyranosyloxy group at position 3 (the 3beta,4alpha,5alpha,24Z stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the roots of Breynia fruticosa. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a deoxyglucose derivative, a monosaccharide derivative, a monothiocarboxylic acid, a steroid acid and a steroid saponin.
