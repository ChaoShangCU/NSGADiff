The molecule is a tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of a dideoxy-4-{[4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohex-2-en-1-yl C7 cyclitol moiety [called valienol (or valienamine)] linked via nitrogen to isomaltotriose. It has a role as an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor, an EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-amylase) inhibitor and a hypoglycemic agent. It is a conjugate base of an acarbose(1+).
