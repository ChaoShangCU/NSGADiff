The molecule is an extended flavonoid that is 3',4'-methylenedioxyflavanone substituted by methoxy groups at positions 5 and 7 and a 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-butenyl moiety at position 8 (the 2S stereoisomer). Isolated from the stem barks of Pongamia pinnata, it acts as a an inducer of quinone reductase, a phase II enzyme that protects cells against reactive, toxic and potentially carcinogenic species. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an extended flavonoid, a member of benzodioxoles, a dimethoxyflavanone and a secondary alcohol.
