The molecule is an N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-(indol-3-yl)butanoic acid with the amino group of L-cysteine. It is a N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid, a secondary carboxamide, a thiol and a member of indoles. It is a conjugate acid of a N-[4-(indol-3-yl)butanoyl]-L-cysteinate.
