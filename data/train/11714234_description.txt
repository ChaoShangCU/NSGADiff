The molecule is an oxazolidinone that is 1,3-oxazolidine-2,4-dione which is substituted on the nitrogen (position 3) by a 4-chloro-5-(cyclopentyloxy)-2-fluorophenyl group, and at position 5 by an isopropylidene group. A protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor, it is used as a pre- and post-emergence herbicide to control weeds in rice. It has a role as an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor, an agrochemical and a herbicide. It is an aromatic ether, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of monofluorobenzenes and an oxazolidinone.
