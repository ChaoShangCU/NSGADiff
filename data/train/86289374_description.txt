The molecule is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion arising from deprotonation of the carboxy and 5-hydroxy groups of luteolin 7-O-[(beta-D-glucosiduronate)-(1->2)-(beta-D-glucosiduronate)] 4'-O-beta-D-glucosiduronate; major microspecies at pH 7.3 (according to Marvin 6.2.0.). It is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and a tricarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a luteolin 7-O-[(beta-D-glucosyluronate)-(1->2)-(beta-D-glucosiduronate)] 4'-O-beta-D-glucosiduronate.
