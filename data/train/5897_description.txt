The molecule is the parent of the class of 2-acetamidofluorenes, being an ortho-fused polycyclic arene that consists of 9H-fluorene bearing an acetamido substituent at position 2. It is a carcinogenic and mutagenic derivative of fluorene. It has a role as an antimitotic, a carcinogenic agent, a mutagen and an epitope. It derives from a hydride of a fluorene.
