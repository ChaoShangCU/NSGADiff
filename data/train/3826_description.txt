The molecule is a racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (R)-(+)- and (S)-(-)-5-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylic acid. While only the (S)-(-) enantiomer is a COX1 and COX2 inhibitor, the (R)-(+) enantiomer exhibits potent analgesic activity. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ketorolac is mainly used (generally as the tromethamine salt) for its potent analgesic properties in the short-term management of post-operative pain, and in eye drops to relieve the ocular itching associated with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. It was withdrawn from the market in many countries in 1993 following association with haemorrhage and renal failure. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and an analgesic. It contains a (R)-ketorolac and a (S)-ketorolac. It is a conjugate acid of a ketorolac(1-).
