The molecule is a dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid that is (4Z,7Z,11E,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid in which the two hydroxy substituents are located at positions 10 and 17 (the 10S,17S-stereoisomer). A natural isomer of protectin D1, one of the specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid and a secondary allylic alcohol.
