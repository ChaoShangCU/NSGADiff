The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that consists of quercetin attached to a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl moiety at position 4' and a beta-D-allopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Acacia pennata, it exhibits inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. It has a role as a metabolite, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor and a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside and a quercetin O-glycoside. It derives from a beta-D-allose.
