The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is isorhamnetin substituted at position 4' by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-L-glucoside, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a trihydroxyflavone. It derives from a beta-L-glucose and an isorhamnetin.
