The molecule is an ethyl 2-(methylamino)-1-phenylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylate that is ent-dextilidine in which one of the methyl groups attached to the nitrogen is replaced by hydrogen. ent-Dextilidine is metabolised to (1R,2S)-nortilidine by the liver. It has a role as a drug metabolite and a NMDA receptor antagonist. It is an enantiomer of a (1S,2R)-nortilidine.
