The molecule is a L-histidine derivative that is L-histidine substituted at poisition 2 (on the imidazole ring) by a 3-carboxy-3-(dimethylamino)propyl group. It is a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a L-histidine derivative. It is a tautomer of a 2-[3-carboxylato-3-(dimethylammonio)propyl]-L-histidine dizwitterion.
