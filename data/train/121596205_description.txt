The molecule is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of salicyluric acid with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucuronic acid. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid and an O-acyl carbohydrate. It derives from a salicyluric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a salicyluric beta-D-glucuronide(1-).
