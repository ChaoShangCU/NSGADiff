The molecule is a trans-2,3-didehydroacyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of trans-oct-2-enoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a 2,3-trans-enoyl CoA(4-), a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a 4-saturated trans-2-enoyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a trans-oct-2-enoyl-CoA.
