The molecule is a glycoside consisting of D-glyceric acid having an alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-glucosyl residue attached at position 2 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is a glycoside, a disaccharide derivative and a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid. It derives from a D-glyceric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-O-[alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-glucosyl]-D-glycerate.
