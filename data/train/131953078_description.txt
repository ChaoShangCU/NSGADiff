The molecule is an alpha-galactosylceramide in which the nitrogen carries a hexacosanamido group and C-4 carries in addition to a hydroxy function a 9-phenylnonyl group. Essentially a phytosphingosine analogue with a truncated lipid chain terminating in a benzene ring, it has been used in investigations on the binding affinity of glycolipids to CD1d molecules. It derives from an alpha-D-galactose.
