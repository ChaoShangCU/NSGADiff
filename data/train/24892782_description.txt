The molecule is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate that is ATP substituted at position N-6 by a (2E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a N-glycosylzeatin, an adenosine 5'-phosphate and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate. It derives from an ATP. It is a conjugate acid of a 9-ribosyl-trans-zeatin 5'-triphosphate(4-).
