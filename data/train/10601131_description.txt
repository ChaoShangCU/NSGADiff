The molecule is a ketoretinoic glucuronide obtained by the glycosylation of the carboxy group of all-trans-4-oxoretinoic acid with beta-glucuronic acid. It is a ketoretinoic acid glucuronide, a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid and an enone. It derives from an all-trans-4-oxoretinoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 1-O-(4-oxoretinoyl)-beta-D-glucuronate.
