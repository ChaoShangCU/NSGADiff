The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of a linear sequence of two alpha-sialyl residues, a beta-D-galactosyl residue and an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue linked respectively (2->8), (2->8) and (1->4), to the galactosyl residue of which is also linked (1->4) an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue. It is the carbohydrate portion of ganglioside GD2. It is an amino pentasaccharide, an amino oligosaccharide and a beta-D-GalNAc-(1->4)-[alpha-Neu5Ac-(2->8)-alpha-Neu5Ac-(2->3)]-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc.
