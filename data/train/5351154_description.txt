The molecule is a hydrazone obtained by formal condensation of the two carbonyl groups of methylglyoxal with the primary amino groups of two molecules of aminoguanidine. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and an EC 4.1.1.50 (adenosylmethionine decarboxylase) inhibitor. It is a hydrazone and a member of guanidines. It derives from a methylglyoxal and an aminoguanidine. It is a conjugate base of a mitoguazone(2+).
