The molecule is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of myristic acid. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a coenzyme A and a tetradecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a myristoyl-CoA(4-).
