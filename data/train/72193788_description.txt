The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
