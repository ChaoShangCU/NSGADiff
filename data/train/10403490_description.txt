The molecule is an abietane diterpenoid that is sugiol in which the hydrogen ortho to the phenolic hydroxy group has been replaced by a hydroxy group. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is an abietane diterpenoid, a carbotricyclic compound, a meroterpenoid, a cyclic terpene ketone and a member of catechols. It derives from a ferruginol and a sugiol.
