The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion derived from 2-O-(6-phosphono-alpha-D-mannosyl)-D-glyceric acid by removal of the two protons from the phosphate group and the proton from the carboxylic acid group. It is an organophosphate oxoanion, a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and a monocarboxylic acid anion. It derives from a 2-(alpha-D-mannosyl)-D-glycerate. It is a conjugate base of a 2-O-(6-phosphono-alpha-D-mannosyl)-D-glyceric acid.
