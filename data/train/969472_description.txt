The molecule is the (5S)- (active) enantiomer of zopiclone. Unlike almost all other hypnotic sedatives, which are approved only for the relief of short-term (6-8 weeks) insomnia, eszopiclone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for long-term use. It has a role as a sedative and a central nervous system depressant. It is an enantiomer of a (5R)-zopiclone.
