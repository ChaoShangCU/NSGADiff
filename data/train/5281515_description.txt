The molecule is a beta-caryophyllene in which the stereocentre adjacent to the exocyclic double bond has S configuration while the remaining stereocentre has R configuration. It is the most commonly occurring form of beta-caryophyllene, occurring in many essential oils, particularly oil of cloves. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a fragrance, a metabolite and an insect attractant. It is an enantiomer of a (+)-beta-caryophyllene.
