The molecule is an epoxy(hydroxy)icosatrienoate that is the conjugate base of 8,9-epoxy-20-hydroxy-(5Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoic acid arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid function; major species at pH 7.3. It is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid anion, a hydroxy fatty acid anion, a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion and an icosanoid anion. It derives from an 8,9-EET(1-). It is a conjugate base of an 8,9-epoxy-20-hydroxy-(5Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoic acid.
