The molecule is a 2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol in which both stereocentres have S-configuration; the (S,S)-enantiomer of the racemic opioid analgesic tramadol, it exhibits ten-fold lower analgesic potency than the (R,R)-enantiomer. It has a role as a delta-opioid receptor agonist, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, an antitussive, a capsaicin receptor antagonist, a muscarinic antagonist, a nicotinic antagonist, a NMDA receptor antagonist, an opioid analgesic, a serotonergic antagonist and a serotonin uptake inhibitor. It is a conjugate base of a (S,S)-tramadol(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (R,R)-tramadol.
