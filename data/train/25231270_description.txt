The molecule is a member of the class of pterocarpans that is pterocarpan substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3, a methylenedioxy group across positions 8 and 9 and a 2,2-dimethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran ring fused across positions 1 and 2 (the 8aR,14aR stereoisomer). Isolated from the stem barks of Maackia amurensis,it exhibits cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a member of pterocarpans, an organic heterohexacyclic compound and a member of phenols.
