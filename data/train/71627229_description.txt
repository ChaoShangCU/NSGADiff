The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z,29Z)-3-oxodotriacontahexaenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z,29Z)-3-oxodotriacontahexaenoyl-CoA(4-).
