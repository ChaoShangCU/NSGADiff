The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (2->3), (1->4) and (1->6), to the galactosamine residue of which is also linked (1->3) a beta-D-galactosyl residue.
