The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z)-hexacosapentaenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and an (11Z)-Delta(11)-fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of an (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z)-hexacosapentaenoyl-CoA.
