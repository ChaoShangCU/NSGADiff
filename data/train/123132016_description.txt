The molecule is a synthetic disaccharide phosphate consisting of an alpha-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-alpha-D-GlcNAc disaccharide linked glycosidically to O-2 of D-glyceric acid and connected to a 5-aminopentyl linker via a phospho group at O-6 of the reducing-end residue. Synthesized for immobilization on microarray surfaces and conjugation to carrier proteins as a potential vaccine candidate to protect from Clostridium difficile infections. It derives from a D-glyceric acid.
