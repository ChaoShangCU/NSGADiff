The molecule is a member of the class of phytosterols that is stigmasta-5,22-diene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 20 (the 3beta,22E stereoisomer). Isolated from the whole plants of Leucas urticifolia, it exhibits cholinesterase inhibitory activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor. It is a member of phytosterols, a 3beta-sterol, a tertiary alcohol and a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid. It derives from a hydride of a stigmastane.
