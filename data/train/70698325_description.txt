The molecule is a branched amino decasaccharide consisting of a linear sequence of N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residues linked respectively (2->3), (1->4), (1->3), (1->4), (1->3) and (1->4), to each N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue of which is linked (1->3) an alpha-L-fucosyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino decasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
