The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-methylpropanoic acid with the secondary amino group of N-methyl-4-(2-methylphenyl)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-3-amine; an antiemetic used in combination with palonosetron hydrochloride (under the trade name Akynzeo) to treat nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. It has a role as an antiemetic and a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, an organofluorine compound, an aminopyridine, a member of toluenes, a N-alkylpiperazine and a N-arylpiperazine.
