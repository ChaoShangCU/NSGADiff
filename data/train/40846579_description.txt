The molecule is an N-acyl-L-alanine resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of L-alanine with the carboxy group of arachidonic acid. It has a role as a mammalian metabolite. It is a N-acyl-L-alanine and a N-(fatty acyl)-L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from an arachidonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-arachidonoyl-L-alaninate.
