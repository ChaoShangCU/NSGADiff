The molecule is a triterpene glycoside that consists of cimigenol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-xylopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a beta-glycosidic linkage (the 23R,24S stereoisomer). It is isolated from the aerial parts of Cimicifuga foetida and exhibits significant immunosuppressive effect. It has a role as an immunosuppressive agent and a plant metabolite. It is a bridged compound, a diol, a disaccharide derivative, an oxacycle, a secondary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a cimigenol. It derives from a hydride of a cycloartane.
