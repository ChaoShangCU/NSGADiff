The molecule is a branched aminopentasaccharide comprising beta-D-glucose at the reducing end with a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-[beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->6)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl moiety at the 4-position. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
