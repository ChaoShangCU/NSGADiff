The molecule is a benzoate ester obtained by the formal condensation of o-orsellinic acid with (4S)-1,4-dihydroxypentan-2-one. Isolated from Chaetomium globosum, it exhibits cytotoxic activity towards cancer cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite, a Chaetomium metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a benzoate ester and a member of resorcinols. It derives from an o-orsellinic acid.
