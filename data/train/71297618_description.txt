The molecule is a high-mannose oligosaccharide that is beta-D-mannopyranose in which the hydrogens of hydroxy groups are replaced by an alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-group at position 6, an alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1right2)-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1right2)-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl group at position 3, and a chitobiose group at position 1. It is an amino sugar, an amino heptasaccharide, an acetamide and a high-mannose oligosaccharide.
