The molecule is an thia-alkylglucosinolic acid that is propylglucosinolic acid in which a hydrogen attached to the terminal carbon of the propyl group has been replaced by a methylsulfanediyl group. It is a thia-alkylglucosinolic acid and an organic sulfide. It derives from a propylglucosinolic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a glucoiberverin(1-).
