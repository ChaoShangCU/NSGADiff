The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is cucurbitacin E attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 2 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Machilus yaoshansis it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cucurbitacin, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a triterpenoid saponin, an acetate ester and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a cucurbitacin E.
