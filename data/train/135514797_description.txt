The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2,2'-bipyridine substituted by a methoxy group at position 4 and a (E)-(hydroxyimino)methyl group at position 6. Isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a marine metabolite and a bacterial metabolite. It is an aldoxime, an aromatic ether, a member of bipyridines and a pyridine alkaloid. It derives from a hydride of a 2,2'-bipyridine.
