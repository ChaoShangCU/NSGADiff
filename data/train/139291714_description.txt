The molecule is an epoxy steroid that is 3beta-hydroxypregnenolone 3-beta-D-glucoside in which the hydrogens at the 16alpha and 17alpha positions have been replaced by the oxygen of the epoxide ring. It is a sterol 3-beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, an epoxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid and a methyl ketone. It derives from a 3beta-hydroxy-16alpha,17alpha-epoxypregnenolone.
