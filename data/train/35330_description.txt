The molecule is the di-4-toluate ester of (+-)-N-tert-butylnoradrenaline (colterol). A pro-drug for colterol, a beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist, bitolterol is used as its methanesulfonate salt for relief of bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It has a role as a bronchodilator agent, an anti-asthmatic drug, a beta-adrenergic agonist and a prodrug. It is a member of ethanolamines, a carboxylic ester, a diester, a secondary amino compound and a secondary alcohol.
