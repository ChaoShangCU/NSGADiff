The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2-trans,6-cis)-dodeca-2,6-dienoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (2-trans,6-cis)-dodeca-2,6-dienoic acid and a coenzyme A.
