The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is hesperitin having an 2-O-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety attached to the 7-hydroxy group. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a neohesperidoside, a disaccharide derivative, a dihydroxyflavanone, a member of 3'-hydroxyflavanones, a monomethoxyflavanone, a flavanone glycoside and a member of 4'-methoxyflavanones. It derives from a hesperetin.
