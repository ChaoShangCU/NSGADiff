The molecule is an alanine derivative that is methyl 3-[2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)quinolin-6-yl]alaninate in which one of the hydrogens attached to the primary amino group is replaced by a 2,6-dichlorobenzyl group. It is a member of quinolines, an alpha-amino acid ester, a dichlorobenzene, a non-proteinogenic amino acid derivative and a secondary amino compound. It derives from a methyl 3-[2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)quinolin-6-yl]alaninate.
