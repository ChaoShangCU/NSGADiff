The molecule is the stereoisomer of N-(2-cyano-3-methylbutan-2-yl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propanamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (S)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propanoic acid with the amino group of (R)-2-amino-2,3-dimethylbutanenitrile. It is an enantiomer of a (R,S)-fenoxanil.
