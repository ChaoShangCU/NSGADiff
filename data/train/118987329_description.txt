The molecule is an L-cysteine derivative in which the sulfur atom carries a 1,4-dihydroxynonan-3-yl substituent. It has been synthesised by reaction of (E)-4-hydroxynon-2-enal (HNE) with L-cysteine, the sulfur atom of cysteine reacting with the double bond function of HNE via formation of a Michael adduct.
