The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4,4-difluorocyclohexanecarboxylic acid and the primary amino group of (1S)-3-[(3-exo)-3-(3-isopropyl-5-methyl-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl]-1-phenylpropylamine. An antiretroviral drug, it prevents the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) necessary for CCR5-tropic HIV-1 to enter cells. It has a role as an antiviral drug, a chemokine receptor 5 antagonist and a HIV fusion inhibitor. It is an azabicycloalkane, an organofluorine compound, a member of triazoles and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
