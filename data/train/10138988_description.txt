The molecule is an enamide resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline with the carboxy group of (2E)-3-(1-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)acrylic acid. It has a role as a Smad3 inhibitor. It is a member of isoquinolines, a pyrrolopyridine, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an aromatic ether, an enamide and a tertiary carboxamide. It is a conjugate base of a SIS3 free base(1+).
