The molecule is the L-(+)-tartaric acid salt of dihydroergotamine, a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid with weaker oxytocic and vasoconstrictor properties than ergotamine. Both the tartrate and the mesylate salts are used for the treatment of migraine and orthostatic hypotension. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist, a non-narcotic analgesic and a vasoconstrictor agent. It contains a dihydroergotamine.
