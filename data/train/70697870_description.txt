The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3 and a [(2E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyl]oxy group at position 2 (the 2alpha,3beta-stereoisomer ). It has been isolated from the root bark of Zizyphus jujuba and Ziziphus cambodianus. It has a role as an antiplasmodial drug and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a hydride of a lupane.
