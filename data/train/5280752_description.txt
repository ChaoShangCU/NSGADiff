The molecule is a luteolin glucosiduronic acid that consists of luteolin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid group at position 7 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid group at position 4' via glycosidic linkages. It is a dihydroxyflavone and a luteolin O-glucuronoside. It is a conjugate acid of a luteolin 7-O-[(beta-D-glucosyluronate)-(1->2)-(beta-D-glucosiduronate)] 4'-O-beta-D-glucosiduronate.
