The molecule is alpha-Ergocryptine in which the isobutyl (2-methylpropyl) substituent is replaced by sec-butyl (1-methylpropyl). It is a natural ergot alkaloid. Note that ergocryptine discussed in the literature prior to 1967, when beta-ergocryptine was separated from alpha-ergocryptine, is now referred to as alpha-ergocryptine. It derives from a hydride of an ergotaman.
