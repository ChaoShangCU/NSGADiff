The molecule is an O(4)-glycosyl-L-hydroxyproline that is cis-L-hydroxylproline glycosylated by a beta-L-Araf moiety. It is an O(4)-glycosyl-L-hydroxyproline, a monosaccharide derivative, a L-proline derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline. It is a tautomer of a 4-O-(beta-L-Araf)-cis-L-Hyp zwitterion.
