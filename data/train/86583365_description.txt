The molecule is a branched hexasaccharide comprised of five alpha-D-mannose residues linked as shown and also to a 3-deoxy-alpha-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; Kdo) residue at the reducing end, corresponding to the core oligosaccharide of the phytopathogenic bacterium Rhizobacterium radiobacter strain Rv3.
