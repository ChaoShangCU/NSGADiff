The molecule is a triterpene glycoside that consists of lanost-8,24-dien-21-oic acid substituted at by a alpha-acetyloxy group at position 3 and a beta-D-xylopyranosyl moiety at position 21 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the fruit body of Fomitopsis pinicola, it exhibits inhibitory activity against COX-1 and COX-2. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor and a fungal metabolite. It is a beta-D-xyloside, an acetate ester, a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a triterpenoid saponin and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a hydride of a lanostane.
