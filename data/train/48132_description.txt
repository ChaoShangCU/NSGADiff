The molecule is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation between (1R)-cis-2,2-dimethyl-3-(1,2,2,2-tetrabromoethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and the alcoholic hydroxy group of (2S)-hydroxy(3-phenoxyphenyl)acetonitrile. It has a role as a pyrethroid ester insecticide. It is an organobromine compound, a nitrile, a member of cyclopropanes, a carboxylic ester and an aromatic ether. It derives from a (1R)-cis-2,2-dimethyl-3-(1,2,2,2-tetrabromoethyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid.
