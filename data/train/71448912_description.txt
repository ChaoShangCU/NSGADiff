The molecule is an oxo fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxylic acid group of (9S,13S)-1a,1b-dinor-10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-15-phytoenoic acid. It is an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (9S,13S)-1a,1b-dinor-10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-15-phytoenoyl-CoA(4-).
