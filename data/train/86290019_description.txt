The molecule is an organosulfate oxoanion that is the conjugate base of (4Z,7Z)-deca-4,7-dien-1-yl hydrogen sulfate. It has been isolated from Daphnia pulex and has been shown to cause morphological changes in the green alga Scenedesmus gutwinskii. It has a role as a kairomone and a Daphnia pulex metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a (4Z,7Z)-deca-4,7-dien-1-yl hydrogen sulfate.
