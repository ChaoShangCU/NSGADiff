The molecule is a 5-L-glutamyl amino acid resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of (2S,4R)-hypoglycin A with the gamma-carboxy group of L-glutamic acid. It has a role as a phytotoxin and a plant metabolite. It is a 5-L-glutamyl amino acid, a member of cyclopropanes and an olefinic compound. It derives from a (2S,4R)-hypoglycin A.
