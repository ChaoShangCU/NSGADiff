The molecule is the hydrochloride salt of (S)-fenfluramine. It stimulates the release of serotonin and selectively inhibits its reuptake, but unlike the racemate it does not possess catecholamine agonist activity. It was formerly given by mouth in the treatment of obesity, but, like the racemate, was withdrawn wolrdwide following reports of valvular heart defects. It has a role as a serotonin uptake inhibitor, a serotonergic agonist and an appetite depressant. It contains a (S)-fenfluramine.
