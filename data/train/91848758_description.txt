The molecule is a trisaccharide that is beta-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 4 have been converted to the corresponding beta-D-galactopyranoside and beta-D-glucopyranoside, respectively. It is a trisaccharide, a beta-D-glucoside and a beta-D-galactoside. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp.
