The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprised of a linear chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, beta-D-galactose and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues linked sequentially (1->4), (1->3) and (1->4), with an alpha-L-fucosyl residue linked (1->2) to the galactose residue proximal to the reducing-end N-acetylglucosamine residue. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
