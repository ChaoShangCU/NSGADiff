The molecule is a quercetin O-glucoside that is quercetin attached to beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkages. Isolated from the aerial parts of Delphinium staphisagria, it exhibits trypanocidal activity. It has a role as a trypanocidal drug and a plant metabolite. It is a quercetin O-glucoside, a trihydroxyflavone and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from an alpha-L-rhamnopyranose. It is a conjugate acid of a petiolaroside(1-).
