The molecule is an aminouracil that is D-ribitol in which the hydroxy group at position 1 is substituted by the 6-amino group of 6-amino-5-(2-oxoethylideneamino)uracil. Unstable mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT)-activating antigen, formed by non-enzymatic reaction between 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil and glyoxal. It has a role as an antigen.
