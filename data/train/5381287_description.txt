The molecule is a polyketide and carboxamide produced by a (Pseudomonas) bacterial endosymbiont of certain rove beetles (genus Paederus). Pederin is the agent responsible for the vesicant effects (linear or Paederus dermatitis) when the beetle is crushed against the skin. It is a powerful inhibitor of protein biosynthesis and mitosis and a potent antitumour agent. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, a vesicant, an antineoplastic agent and an antimitotic. It is a polyketide, a cyclic ketal, a diol, a member of oxanes, a secondary alcohol and a secondary carboxamide.
