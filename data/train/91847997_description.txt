The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 2 of the central alpha-D-galactopyranosyl moiety has been glycosylated by an alpha-L-fucopyranosyl group. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1->3)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)]-alpha-D-Galp.
