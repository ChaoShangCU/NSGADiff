The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine at the reducing end having an alpha-L-fucosyl residue attached at the 3-position and an alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-galactosyl moiety attached at the 4-position. A cancer-associated tetrasaccharide antigen which constitutes the core structure recognised by therapeutic antibody BR96. Conformational restriction around the GlcNAc residue is a key feature of its structure. It has a role as an antigen and an epitope.
