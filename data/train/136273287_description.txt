The molecule is a single-stranded DNA polynucleotide consisting of a repeating unit of brominated deoxyguanosine and deoxycytidine residues, with all residues connected by 3'->5' phosphodiester linkages. The sites of bromination are at C-8 of guanine and C-5 of cytosine, although not all these sites are brominated, with bromination at the guanine C-8 predominating.
