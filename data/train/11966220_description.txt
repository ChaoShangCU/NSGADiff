The molecule is an (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2S,3S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a hydroxybutanoyl-CoA and a methylbutanoyl-CoA. It derives from a (2S,3S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid and a butyryl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2S,3S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoyl-CoA(4-).
