The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is oleanane which has been substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta and 16beta positions, dehydrogenated to introduce a double bond at the 12-13 position, and in which the methyl substituent at position 17 has undergone oxidation to give the corresponding carboxylic acid. Found in the cactus Myrtillocactus cochal. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a monocarboxylic acid, a secondary alcohol and a hydroxy carboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a cochalate. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
