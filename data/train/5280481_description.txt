The molecule is a C19-gibberellin that is a pentacyclic diterpenoid responsible for promoting growth and development. Initially identified in Gibberella fujikuroi, it differs from gibberellin A1 in lacking an OH group at C-2 (gibbane numbering). It has a role as a plant metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a lactone, a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid and a C19-gibberellin. It is a conjugate acid of a gibberellin A20(1-).
