The molecule is beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-{alpha-Neu5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fuc-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->6)}-D-GalNAc in which the anomeric configuration of the GalNAc residue at the reducing end is alpha. It is a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-{alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->6)}-D-GalNAc and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
