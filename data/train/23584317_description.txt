The molecule is a dibromophenol that is 2,4-dibromophenol substituted at position 6 by a decahydronaphthalen-1-ylmethyl group which in turn is substituted by a bromo, 3-bromo-4-chloro-4-methylpentyl group, two methyl groups and a methylidene group at positions 6, 5, 5, 8a and 2 respectively. A diterpenoid isolated from the Fijian red alga Callophycus serratus, it exhibits antibacterial, antimalarial and anticancer activities. It has a role as a metabolite, an antibacterial agent, an antimalarial and an antineoplastic agent. It is a dibromophenol, an organochlorine compound and a carbobicyclic compound.
