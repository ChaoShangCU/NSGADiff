The molecule is an N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid anion resulting from deprotonation of both carboxy groups of N-acetyl-L-glutamic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid anion and a dicarboxylic acid dianion. It derives from a L-glutamate(2-). It is a conjugate base of a N-acetyl-L-glutamate(1-).
