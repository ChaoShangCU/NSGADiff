The molecule is a C21-steroid that is cortisol bearing an additional hydroxy substituent at the 6beta-position. In humans, it is produced as a metabolite of cortisol by cytochrome p450-3A4 (CYP3A4, an important enzyme involved in the metabolism of a variety of exogenous and endogenous compounds) and can be used to detect moderate and potent CYP3A4 inhibition in vivo. It has a role as a mammalian metabolite, a human metabolite and a probe. It is a C21-steroid, a 6beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a 20-oxo steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a cortisol.
