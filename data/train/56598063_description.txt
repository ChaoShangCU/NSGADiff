The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is (3beta,16alpha)-13,28-epoxyoleanane-3,16-diol attached to a tetrasaccharide residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a cyclic ether, a secondary alcohol, a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a tetrasaccharide derivative, a triterpenoid saponin and an acetate ester. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
