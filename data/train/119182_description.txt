The molecule is a purine nucleoside analogue consisting of a 6-amino-2-chloropurin-9-yl group attached to the 1beta position of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-D-arabinofuranose. It is metabolized intracellularly to the active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, which inhibits DNA synthesisis and so stops the growth of cancer cells. Clofarabine is used as an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent in the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an antimetabolite. It is an organofluorine compound and a member of adenosines.
