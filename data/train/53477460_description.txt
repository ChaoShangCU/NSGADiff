The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acid consisting of (7E,9E,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoic acid carrying additional (18R)-hydroxy and (5S,6S)-epoxy groups. It has a role as a human blood serum metabolite and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is an epoxy fatty acid, an icosanoid, a long-chain fatty acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 5(S),6(S)-epoxy-18(R)-hydroxy-(7E,9E,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoate.
