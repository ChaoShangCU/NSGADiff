The molecule is a dipeptide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of L-alpha-aminobutyric acid [(2S)-2-aminobutanoic acid] with the amino group of glycine. It is a dipeptide, a glycine derivative, a secondary carboxamide, a primary amino compound and a carboxylic acid. It derives from a L-alpha-aminobutyric acid. It is a tautomer of a N-[(2S)-2-ammoniobutanoyl]glycinate.
