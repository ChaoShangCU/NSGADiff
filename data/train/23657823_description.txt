The molecule is an N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid anion resulting from deprotonation of both carboxy groups and protonation of the amide nitrogen of N-acetyl-L-glutamic acid. It derives from a L-glutamate(1-). It is a conjugate base of a N-acetyl-L-glutamic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-acetyl-L-glutamate(2-).
