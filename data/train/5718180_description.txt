The molecule is a semicarbazone obtained by formal condensation of the keto group of N-[(5-acetyl-3-thienyl)methyl]-2-chloroacetamide with the hydrazino group of semicarbazide. It is a member of thiophenes, a member of ureas, an organochlorine compound, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a semicarbazone. It derives from a chloroacetic acid and a semicarbazide.
