A semi-synthetic analogue of geldanamycin, it is used (generally as the hydrochloride salt) in cancer treatment. It has a role as a Hsp90 inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of hydroquinones, an ansamycin, an organic heterobicyclic compound, a secondary amino compound, a semisynthetic derivative and a carbamate ester. It derives from a geldanamycin. It is a conjugate base of a retaspimycin(1+).
