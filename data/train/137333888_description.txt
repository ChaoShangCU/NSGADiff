The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 5-{[(5-tert-butyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)methyl]sulfanyl}-1,3-thiazol-2-amine. It is a CDK18 kinase inhibitor. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of 1,3-oxazoles, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an organic sulfide, a secondary carboxamide and a member of oxanes.
