The molecule is an abietane diterpenoid that is 11-hydroxysugiol in which one of the hydrogens of the methyl group attached to a ring junction has been replaced by a hydroxy group. It has a role as an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is a carbotricyclic compound, a meroterpenoid, an abietane diterpenoid, a member of catechols, a primary alcohol and a cyclic terpene ketone. It derives from a ferruginol, an 11-hydroxysugiol and an 11,20-dihydroxyferruginol.
