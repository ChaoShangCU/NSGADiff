The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3R,11Z)-3-hydroxyicosenoic acid It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R,11Z)-3-hydroxyicosenoyl-CoA(4-).
