The molecule is a 2-enoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 2-methylhexenoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a 2-enoyl-CoA, a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-methylhexenoyl-CoA(4-).
