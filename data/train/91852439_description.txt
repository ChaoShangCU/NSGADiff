The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 6 have been converted into the corresponding beta-D-galactopyranosyl and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyransoyl derivatives, respectively. It is an amino trisaccharide, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc and a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-beta-D-GalpNAc.
