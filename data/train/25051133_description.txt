The molecule is a tetrasaccharide comprising residues of galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose and N-acetylglucosamine units in a linear sequence, joined sequentially via beta(1->3), beta(1->3), and beta(1->4) linkages. beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc with beta-configuration at the anomeric centre of the reducing-end N-acetylglucosamine residue. It has a role as an epitope.
