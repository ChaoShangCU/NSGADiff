The molecule is a hydroxamic acid resulting from the formal condensation of the primary amino group of N-(3-aminopropyl)-N-hydroxyacetamide (2 mol eq.) with the carboxy groups at positions 1 and 3 of citric acid. It is a siderophore produced by Bacillus megaterium and Anabaena species. It has a role as a siderophore and a bacterial metabolite. It is a hydroxamic acid and a 2-hydroxy carboxylic acid. It derives from a citric acid.
