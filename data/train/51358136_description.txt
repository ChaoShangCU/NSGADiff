The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is luteolin substituted by a alpha-L-rhamnosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from Crotalaria lachnophora. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, an alpha-L-rhamnoside and a trihydroxyflavone. It derives from a luteolin.
