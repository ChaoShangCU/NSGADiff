The molecule is an sesquiterpenoid that is decahydronaphthalene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 1 and 2, a methyl group at position 8a, a methylidene group at position 4 and a 1,2-dihydroxypropan-2-yl at position 6 (the 1R,2R,4aR,6S,8aS stereoisomer). Isolated from Solanum lyratum, it exhibits cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a tetrol, a secondary alcohol, a carbobicyclic compound, a primary alcohol and a sesquiterpenoid.
