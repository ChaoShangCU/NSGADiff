The molecule is a quinoline alkaloid that is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-6-carboxamide substituted by a chloro group at position 3 and a 3,4-dimethylpent-3-en-1-yl and a methoxymethyl group at position 2 (the 2R,3R stereoisomer). Isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces nitrosporeus 30643, it exhibits inhibitory potential against lipid peroxidation and anti-HSV activity. It has a role as a metabolite, a radical scavenger and an anti-HSV agent. It is a quinoline alkaloid, an organochlorine compound, an ether and a member of benzamides.
