The molecule is a monohydroxyflavanone that is (2S)-7-hydroxyflavanone substituted at position 8 by a tetrahydrofuran ring which in turn is substituted by geminal methyl groups at position 2 and a cinnamoyloxy group at position 3. Isolated from Tephrosia purpurea, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a cinnamate ester, a monohydroxyflavanone and a member of oxolanes.
