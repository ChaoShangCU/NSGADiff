The molecule is a docosanoid that is (4Z,8E,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at the 7S- and 14S-positions. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid, a lipid hydroperoxide and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid.
