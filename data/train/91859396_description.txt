The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consistinng of beta-D-galactopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl and D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->4) and (1->6) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc.
