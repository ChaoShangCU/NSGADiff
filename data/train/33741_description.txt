The molecule is a 2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol in which both stereocentres have R-configuration; the (R,R)-enantiomer of the racemic opioid analgesic tramadol, it exhibits ten-fold higher analgesic potency than the (S,S)-enantiomer. It has a role as a delta-opioid receptor agonist, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, an antitussive, a capsaicin receptor antagonist, a muscarinic antagonist, a nicotinic antagonist, a NMDA receptor antagonist, an opioid analgesic, a serotonergic antagonist, a serotonin uptake inhibitor and a metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a (R,R)-tramadol(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (S,S)-tramadol.
