The molecule is a steroid saponin that is beta-sitosterol substituted by a 3-O-hexacosanoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Acer okamotoanum, it exhibits anti-complement activity. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a steroid saponin, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a sitosterol and a hexacosanoic acid. It derives from a hydride of a stigmastane.
