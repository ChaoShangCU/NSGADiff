The molecule is a pentasaccharide derivative that is beta-D-Manp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc in which the mannosyl group has been glycosylated by alpha-D-mannopyranosyl groups at positions 3 and 6. It is an amino sugar and a pentasaccharide derivative. It derives from a beta-D-Manp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
