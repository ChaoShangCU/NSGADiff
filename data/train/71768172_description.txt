The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the phosphate to the amino group of 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; major species at pH 7.3. It is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion, a lysophosphatidylethanolamine zwitterion 18:1 and an oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion. It derives from an oleic acid. It is a tautomer of a 2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
