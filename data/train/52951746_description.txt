The molecule is a homoflavonoid glycoside that is 5'-prenylophioglonol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the whole plants of Ophioglossum pedunculosum. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a homoflavonoid glycoside and a hydroxy homoflavonoid. It derives from an ophioglonol.
