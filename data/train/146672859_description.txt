The molecule is a linear trisaccharide derivative consisting of 2-acetamido-4-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-beta-D-mannuronic acid, N-acetyl-alpha-L-fucosamine and N-acetyl-alpha-D-fucosamine residues all linked sequentially (1->3) with the N-acetylfucosamine residue linked glycosidically to a 3-aminopropyl group. A synthetic conjugation-ready CP8 trisaccharide bearing an amine linker, which effectively serves for immunological evaluation in Staphylococcus aureus vaccine development. It is a trisaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
