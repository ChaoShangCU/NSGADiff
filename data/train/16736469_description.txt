The molecule is a cardenolide glycoside that is carda-4,20(22)-dienolide substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 14, an oxo group at position 12 and a (4-deoxy-3-O-methyl-alpha-L-erythro-pentopyranosyl)oxy moiety at position 3 (the 2alpha,3beta stereoisomer). Isolated from from wood of Elaeodendron tangenala, it exhibits antiproliferative activity against A2780 human ovarian cancer cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cardenolide glycoside and a monosaccharide derivative.
