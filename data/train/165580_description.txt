The molecule is an amino cyclitol glycoside that is the 1-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside) and the 3-O-(2,6-diamino-2,6-dideoxy-beta-L-idopyranosyl)-beta-D-ribofuranoside of 4,6-diamino-2,3-dihydroxycyclohexane (the 1R,2R,3S,4R,6S diastereoisomer). It is obtained from various Streptomyces species. A broad-spectrum antibiotic, it is used (generally as the sulfate salt) for the treatment of acute and chronic intestinal protozoal infections, but is not effective for extraintestinal protozoal infections. It is also used as a therapeutic against visceral leishmaniasis. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, an antiprotozoal drug, an anthelminthic drug and an antiparasitic agent. It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic and an amino cyclitol glycoside. It derives from a streptamine.
