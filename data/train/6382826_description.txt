The molecule is a dinitrile that is tert-butylbenzene in which the hydrogen at the para- position is substituted by a 4,4-dicyano-2-methylbuta-1,3-dien-1-yl group (the trans isomer). It is used as a matrix in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. It has a role as a MALDI matrix material.
