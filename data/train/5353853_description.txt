The molecule is an oxime O-ether that is the 2,4-dichlorobenzyl ether of the oxime obtained by formal condensation of hydroxylamine with the carbonyl group of acetopnenone in which the phenyl group is substituted by chlorines at positions 2 and 4, and in which one of the hydrogens of the methyl group is replaced by a 1H-imidazol-1-yl group. An antifungal agent, it is used (generally as the nitrate salt) in creams and powders for the topical treatment of fungal skin infections. It has a role as an antiinfective agent. It is a member of imidazoles, an oxime O-ether, a dichlorobenzene, an imidazole antifungal drug and a conazole antifungal drug. It is a conjugate base of an oxiconazole(1+).
