The molecule is a hydroperoxy fatty acid that is (10E,12Z,14E)-octadecatrienoic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at positions 9 and 16 (the 9S,16S-diastereomer). It is a hydroperoxy fatty acid, a lipid hydroperoxide, a long-chain fatty acid, an octadecanoid and a trienoic fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9S,10E,12Z,14E,16S)-9,16-bis(hydroperoxy)octadecatrienoate.
