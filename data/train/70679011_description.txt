The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (5Z)-tetradecenoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a cis-tetradec-5-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (5Z)-tetradecenoyl-CoA(4-).
