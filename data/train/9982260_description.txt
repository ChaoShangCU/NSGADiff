The molecule is a 17-oxosteroid that is 17-oxo-5beta,9beta,10alpha,13alpha-androsta-11,15-dieneandroxta-11,15-diene which is substituted by an acetoxy group at the 3beta position, methyl groups at the 4, 4, 8, 12, and 16 positions, a methoxycarbonyl group at position 14, and a hydroxy group at position 15. A farnesyltransferase inhibitor produced by Penicillium roqueforti, a filamentous fungus involved in the ripening of several kinds of blue cheeses. It has a role as an EC 2.5.1.58 (protein farnesyltransferase) inhibitor and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a 15-hydroxy steroid, a 17-oxo steroid, a 5beta steroid, an acetate ester, an enol, a meroterpenoid and a methyl ester. It is a conjugate acid of an andrastin C(1-).
