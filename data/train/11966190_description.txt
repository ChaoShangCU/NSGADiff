The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of all-cis-icosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an all-cis-icosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoyl-CoA(4-).
