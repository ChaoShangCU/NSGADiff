The molecule is a branched pentasaccharide consisting of an D-GlcNAc residue at the reducing end with a beta-D-Xyl(1->2)-beta-D-Man(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc moiety attached via a beta-(1->4)-linkage and a D-Fuc residue attached via an alpha-(1->3)-linkage. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
