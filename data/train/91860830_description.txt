The molecule is a glycosyl alditol derivative consisting of D-galactopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactitol residues joined in sequence by (1->4) and (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is a glycosyl alditol derivative, a partially-defined glycan and a member of acetamides. It derives from a N-acetyl-D-galactosaminitol, a D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc and a 3-O-(N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminitol.
