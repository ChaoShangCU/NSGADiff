The molecule is a L-tryptophan derivative that is L-tryptophan in which the hydrogen attached to the indole nitrogen replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a monosaccharide derivative, a N-glycosyl compound, a L-tryptophan derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a beta-D-glucose.
