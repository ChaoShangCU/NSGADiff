The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprising a linear chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, linked (1->3), (1->3) and (1->4) respectively, with an alpha-L-fucose residue linked to each N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue, (1->3)-linked to the reducing-end GlcNAc and (1->4)linked to the GlcNAc at the non-reducing end. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
