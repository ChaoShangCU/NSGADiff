The molecule is a hopanoid that is hopane substituted by an acetoxy group at position 3 and hydroxy groups at positions 15 and 22 (the 3beta,15alpha-stereoisomer). It has been isolated from Aschersonia species and Hypocrella species. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It is a hopanoid, a diol, an acetate ester and a pentacyclic triterpenoid.
