The molecule is the ester obtained by formal condensation of 4-butylaminobenzoic acid with nonaethylene glycol monomethyl ether. Structurally related to procaine and benzocaine, it has an anaesthetic effect on the stretch sensors in the lungs, and is used as a non-narcotic cough suppressant. It has a role as an antitussive and an anaesthetic. It is a benzoate ester, a substituted aniline and a secondary amino compound. It derives from a 4-(butylamino)benzoic acid and a nonaethylene glycol monomethyl ether.
