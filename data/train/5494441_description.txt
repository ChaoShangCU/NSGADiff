The molecule is a diester resulting from the formal sequential esterification of the hydroxy group of one molecule of (3R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid with the carboxy group of a second, followed by the esterification of the hydroxy group of the product with the carboxy group of a third molecule of (3R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. Isolated from the Japanese inedible mushroom Hypoxylon truncatum and also the sponge-derived actinomycete Micromonospora sp. RV43. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It is a diester and a (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid oligomer. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R)-3-{[(3R)-3-{[(3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl]oxy}butanoyl]oxy}butanoate.
