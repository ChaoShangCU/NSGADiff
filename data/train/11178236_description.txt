The molecule is an organic bromide salt consisting of sepantronium cations and bromide anions. It has been found to selectively inhibit survivin (BIRC5) gene promoter activity and to down-regulate survivin in vitro, so leading to induction of apoptosis. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a survivin suppressant and an apoptosis inducer. It contains a sepantronium.
