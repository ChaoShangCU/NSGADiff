The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid obtained by the formal condensation of 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid with the 3-hydroxy group of betulinic acid. It is isolated from the Chinese herb Syzygium claviflorum. The first in the class of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors to be studied in humans, bevirimat was identified as a potent HIV drug candidate and several clinical trials were conducted, but development into a new drug was plagued by numerous resistance-related problems. It has a role as a metabolite and a HIV-1 maturation inhibitor. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a dicarboxylic acid monoester and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a betulinic acid.
