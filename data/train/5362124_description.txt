The molecule is a benzazepine that is benazeprilat in which the carboxy group of the 2-amino-4-phenylbutanoic acid moiety has been converted to the corresponding ethyl ester. It is used (generally as its hydrochloride salt) as a prodrug for the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazeprilat in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and a prodrug. It is a benzazepine, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, an ethyl ester and a lactam. It derives from a benazeprilat. It is a conjugate base of a benazepril(1+).
