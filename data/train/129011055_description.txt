The molecule is a methyl glycoside that consists of a 4-O-(5-aminopentyl)-alpha-D-mannose residue and two N-formyl-alpha-D-perosamine residues linked sequentially (1->2) and (1->3) and linked at the reducing end glycosidically to a methyl group. It is a methyl glycoside and a trisaccharide derivative.
