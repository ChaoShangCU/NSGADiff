The molecule is a branched hexasaccharide derivative consisting of a linear pentasaccharide unit of beta-D-galactose, alpha-D-galactose, beta-L-rhamnose, beta-D-glucose and N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (1->2), (1->3), (1->4) and (1->3), to the N-acetylgalactosamine residue of which is also linked (1->4) an alpha-L-rhamnosyl residue, the whole linked glycosidically to a 5-aminopentyl group. It is a glycoside and a hexasaccharide derivative.
