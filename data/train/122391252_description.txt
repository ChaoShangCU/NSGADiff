The molecule is a member of the class of benzothiazoles that is Photinus luciferin in which the phenolic hydroxy group has been replaced by a sulfo group. Enzymatic derivative of firefly luciferin produced by luciferin sulfotransferase (LST) from luciferin with 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as co-substrate. Not a substrate for firefly luciferase. Likely the in-vivo storage form of luciferin. It has a role as an animal metabolite. It is a 1,3-thiazolemonocarboxylic acid, a member of benzothiazoles, an imidothioate and an aryl sulfate. It derives from a Photinus luciferin. It is a conjugate acid of a firefly D-sulfoluciferin(2-).
