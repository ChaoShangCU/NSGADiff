The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) species arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of decanoyl-CoA. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a decanoyl-CoA.
