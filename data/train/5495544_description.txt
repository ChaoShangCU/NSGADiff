The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxyflavone attached to (6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the whole plant of Lepisorus contortus. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a disaccharide derivative and a trihydroxyflavone.
