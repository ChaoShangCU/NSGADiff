The molecule is an icosanoid anion that is the conjugate base of (5Z,9E,11Z,14Z,17Z)-8-hydroperoxyicosapentaenoic acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group; major species at pH 7.3 It is a long-chain fatty acid anion and a hydroperoxyicosapentaenoate. It derives from an all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoate. It is a conjugate base of a (5Z,9E,11Z,14Z,17Z)-8-hydroperoxyicosapentaenoic acid.
