The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is myricetin 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside] in which the terminal glucose residue has been esterified at position 6 by formal condensation with 4-coumaric acid. Identified in Fig. S21 of PMID:29967287. It is a pentahydroxyflavone, a cinnamate ester, a disaccharide derivative and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a myricetin and a trans-4-coumaric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-trans-4-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside](2-).
