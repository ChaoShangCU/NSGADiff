The molecule is a hexacyclic triterpenoid that is 13,28-epoxyursan-28-one with a terminal double bond between positions 20(30) and is substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3 (the 3beta,19alpha stereoisomer). It is a taraxastane-type triterpene isolated from Hypericum oblongifolium and exhibits enzyme inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.4.21.1 (chymotrypsin) inhibitor. It is a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a gamma-lactone, a bridged compound and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a hydride of a taraxastane.
