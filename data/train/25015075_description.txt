The molecule is a carboxylic ester obtained by formal condensation between the carboxy group of (1R,3R)-3-[(1Z)-2-cyanoprop-1-en-1-yl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid with the benzylic hydroxy group of [2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(methoxymethyl)phenyl]methanol. It has a role as a pyrethroid ester insecticide and an agrochemical. It is a carboxylic ester, a member of cyclopropanes, an ether, an organofluorine insecticide, a tetrafluorobenzene and a nitrile.
