The molecule is a member of the class of indoles that is 2-methyltryptamine in which a hydrogen attached to the primary amino group has been replaced by a 2-fluorobenzoyl group. It is a cell-permeable inhibitor of actin assembly mediated by actin-related protein Arp2/3 complex which works by binding to Arp2/3 complex, stabilising the inactive state of the complex and preventing its movement into the active conformation. It is a member of indoles, an organofluorine compound and a member of benzamides.
