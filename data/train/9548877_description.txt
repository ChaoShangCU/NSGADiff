The molecule is an HPODE (hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid) in which the double bonds are at positions 10 and 12 (E and Z geometry, respectively) and the hydroperoxy group is at position 9 (S configuration). It is an intermediate in the metabolic pathway for linoleic acid. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a (10E,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 9(S)-HPODE(1-). It is an enantiomer of a 9(R)-HPODE.
