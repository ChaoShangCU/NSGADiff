The molecule is a C19-gibberellin that is a pentacyclic diterpenoid responsible for promoting growth and elongation of cells in plants. Initially identified in Gibberella fujikuroi it differs from gibberellin A1 in the absence of OH groups at C-2 and C-7 (gibbane numberings). It has a role as a plant metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a lactone, a C19-gibberellin and a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a gibberellin A9(1-).
