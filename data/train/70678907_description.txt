The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide in which an alpha-L-fucosyl residue is linked (1->2) to the middle galactosyl residue of an N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine trisaccharide. It has a role as an epitope. It is a galactosamine oligosaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an amino tetrasaccharide.
