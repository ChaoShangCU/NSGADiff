The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (R)-3-hydroxyoctacosanoyl-CoA [(R)-3-hydroxymontanoyl-CoA]; major species at pH 7.3. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA(4-), a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (R)-3-hydroxyoctacosanoyl-CoA.
