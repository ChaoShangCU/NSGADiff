The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoamide obtained by formal condensation of the anilino group of P-(4-aminobenzyl)-N-(4-nitrophenyl)phosphonamidic acid with one of the carboxy groups of glutaric acid. It has a role as a hapten. It is an organic phosphoramidate, a C-nitro compound and a dicarboxylic acid monoamide. It derives from a 4-nitroaniline and a glutaric acid.
