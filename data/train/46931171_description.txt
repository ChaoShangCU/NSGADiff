The molecule is the anion formed from 6-methyl-7-oxo-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine by removal of a proton from the nitrogen at position 3 (i.e. between the oxo groups). It is the major species at physiological pH. It derives from a lumazine and a ribitol. It is a conjugate base of a 6-methyl-7-oxo-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine (2-oxo tautomer). It is a tautomer of a 6-methyl-7-oxo-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine (2-hydroxy tautomer)(1-).
