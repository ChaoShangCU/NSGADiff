The molecule is a disaccharide consisting of a beta-D-galactopyranose residue joined to a D-xylopyranose residue by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. Used to diagnose hypolactasia (lactose intolerance as a result of lactase deficiency) via presence of D-xylose after cleavage by lactase. It has a role as a diagnostic agent. It derives from a beta-D-galactose and a D-xylopyranose.
