The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide comprised of a trisaccharide chain of N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminic acid, 6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glactose and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues linked sequentially (2->3) and (1->4), to the GlcNAC residue of which is also linked (1->3) an alpha-L-fucose residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
