The molecule is a cardenolide glycoside that is 3,5,11,14-tetrahydroxy-19-oxocard-20(22)-enolide glycosylated at position 3 by a beta-allosyl-(1->4)-beta-6-deoxyallosyl group. Isolated from Elaeodendron alluaudianum, it exhibits antiproliferative activity against human ovarian cancer and human histiocytic lymphoma cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cardenolide glycoside, a hydroxy steroid, a steroid lactone and a steroid aldehyde.
