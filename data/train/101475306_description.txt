The molecule is a glycoside formed between the branched tetrasaccharide alpha-L-Fuc-(1->2)-[alpha-D-GalNAc-(1->3)]-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-Glc and the alkenyl alcohol oct-7-en-1-ol. It contains an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-[alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1->3)]-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-yl group. It derives from an oct-7-en-1-ol.
