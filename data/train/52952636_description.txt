The molecule is a kaempferol O-glucoside that is the 2''-acetyl derivative of kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (paeonoside). Isolated from Delphinium staphisagria, it exhibits trypanocidal activity. It has a role as a metabolite, a trypanocidal drug and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an acetate ester, a dihydroxyflavone and a kaempferol O-glucoside. It derives from a kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside.
