The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate OH groups of 2,3-bis-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate; major species at pH 7.3. It is an anionic phospholipid and a 2,3-bis-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol 1-phospholipid anion. It derives from a 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol. It is a conjugate base of a 2,3-bis-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate.
