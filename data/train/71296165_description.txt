The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide consisting of a chain of four alpha-sialyl residues, a beta-D-galactosyl residue and a beta-D-glucose residue linked sequentially (2->8), (2->8), (2->8), (2->3) and (1->4), to the galactosyl residue of which is also linked (1->4) an N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino heptasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
