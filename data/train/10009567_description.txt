The molecule is a member of the class of tetracenomycins that is 8-demethyltetracenomycin C in which the hydroxyl hydrogens at position 8 and 10 a are replaced by a 2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyl and methyl groups respectively. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite and an antimicrobial agent. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a carboxylic ester, an enol ether, an enone, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of phenols, a tetracenomycin, a methyl ester and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a tetracenomycin C.
