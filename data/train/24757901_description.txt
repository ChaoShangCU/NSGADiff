The molecule is a diterpene glycoside that is labd-14-en-11-one substituted by beta-acetoxy group at position 6, an epoxy group between positions 8 and 13, a beta-hydroxy group at position 7 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 1 (the 1alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from the whole plant of Coleus forskohlii, it shows relaxative effects on isolated guinea pig tracheal spirals in vitro. It has a role as a metabolite and a muscle relaxant. It is a labdane diterpenoid, a diterpene glycoside, an acetate ester, a beta-D-glucoside, a cyclic ketone and a cyclic ether.
