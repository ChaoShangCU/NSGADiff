The molecule is a methylpyridine that coinsists of 2-methylp[yridine bearing an additional phenylethynyl group at position 6. Potent and highly selective non-competitive antagonist at the mGlu5 receptor subtype (IC50 = 36 nM) and a positive allosteric modulator at mGlu4 receptors. Centrally active following systemic administration in vivo. Reverses mechanical hyperalgesia in the inflamed rat hind paw. It has a role as a metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist and an anxiolytic drug. It is a member of methylpyridines and an acetylenic compound. It is a conjugate base of a 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridinium(1+). It derives from a hydride of an acetylene.
