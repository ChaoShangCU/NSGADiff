The molecule is an azaphilone that is the ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2,4-dimethylhexanoic acid with the tertiary hydroxy group of 7-hydroxy-7-methyl-6,8-dioxo-2,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is an azaphilone, a member of isoquinolines, a beta-diketone, a carboxylic ester, a cyclic ketone, a dioxo monocarboxylic acid and a polyketide.
