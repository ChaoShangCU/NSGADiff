The molecule is a disaccharide derivative in which alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-alpha-D-galactosamine is linked glycosidically to biotin via a (21-oxo-3,6,9,12,15,18-hexaoxa-22-azapentacosan-1-yl)amino spacer. One of a set of synthesised biotinylated oligo-alpha-(1->4)-D-galactosamines comprising from two to six monosaccharide units, along with their N-acetylated derivatives (PMID:31913631), aimed at analysing the specificity of the antibody responses to a complex exopolysaccharide galactosaminogalactan found in Aspergillus fumigatus, the most important airborne human fungal pathogen in industrialized countries. It is a disaccharide derivative and a member of biotins.
