The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 4,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-xylo-hexopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->2) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc.
