The molecule is a 1-monoglyceride resulting from the formal condensation of 1-(all-cis-docosa-7,10,13,16-tetraenoic acid (adrenic acid) with one of the primary hydroxy groups of glycerol. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor and an EC 3.1.1.4 (phospholipase A2) inhibitor. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-7,10,13,16-tetraenoic acid.
