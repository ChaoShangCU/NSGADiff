The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid that consists of 17alpha-estradiol having beta-glucuronyl and alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl residues attached via glycosidic linkages at positions 3 and 17 respectively. It derives from a 17alpha-estradiol. It is a conjugate acid of a 17alpha-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl)estradiol 3-glucosiduronate.
