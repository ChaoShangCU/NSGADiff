The molecule is an amino cyclitol glycoside that is 4,6-diaminocyclohexane-1,2,3-triol having a 2,6-diamino-2,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucosyl residue attached at position 1 and a beta-D-ribosyl residue attached at position 2. It is an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces ribosidificus (formerly S. thermoflavus). It has a role as a metabolite, an antimicrobial agent and an antibacterial drug. It is an amino cyclitol glycoside and an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It is a conjugate base of a ribostamycin(4+).
