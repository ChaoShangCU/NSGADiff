The molecule is a bicyclic macrolide natural product consisting of a 16-membered bicyclic lactone attached to the rare 2-thiazolidinone moiety. It is obtained from the Red Sea sponge Latrunculia magnifica and from the Fiji Islands sponge Cacospongia mycofijiensis. Latrunculin A inhibits actin polymerisation, microfilament organsation and microfilament-mediated processes. It has a role as a toxin, a metabolite and an actin polymerisation inhibitor. It is a cyclic hemiketal, an oxabicycloalkane, a thiazolidinone and a macrolide.
