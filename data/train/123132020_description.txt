The molecule is a hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoate obtained by deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group of (9Z,11S,12Z,15Z)-11-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid. Major microspecies at pH 7.3. It derives from an alpha-linolenate. It is a conjugate base of a (9Z,11S,12Z,15Z)-11-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid. It is an enantiomer of a (9Z,11R,12Z,15Z)-11-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoate.
