The molecule is a N(5)-alkylglutamine obtained by formal condensation of the side-chain carboxy group of L-glutamic acid with the amino group of L-alaninol. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It derives from a (S)-2-aminopropan-1-ol. It is a tautomer of a N-(gamma-L-glutamyl)-L-alaninol zwitterion.
