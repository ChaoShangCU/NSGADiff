The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3S,5Z)-3-hydroxytetradec-5-enoic acid. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3S,5Z)-3-hydroxytetradec-5-enoyl-CoA(4-).
