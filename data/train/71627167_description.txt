The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosatrienoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosatrienoyl-CoA(4-).
