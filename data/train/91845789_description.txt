The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of a D-galactopyranose residue and a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residue joined in sequence by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. The configuration of the anomeric centre of each residue is not stated. It is a partially-defined glycan, an amino disaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a D-galactopyranose and a N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
