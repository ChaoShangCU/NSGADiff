The molecule is a 3beta-hydroxy steroid that is androst-5-en-3beta-ol in which the 17beta-hydrogen has been replaced by a 1,3-dihydroxy-3,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)propyl group. NCS172285 (also known as acts as NSC12) has been used as an extracellular fibroblast growth factor (FGF) trap with implications in cancer therapy. The stereochemistry shown is that of the most active stereoisomer, as determined by Mattia Anselmi (PhD thesis, University of Parma, 2015). It is a 20-hydroxy steroid, a fluorinated steroid and a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid.
