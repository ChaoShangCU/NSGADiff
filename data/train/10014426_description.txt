The molecule is a fluoroindole that is 6-fluoroindole in which the hydrogen at position 3 has been replaced by a 2-(pyridin-3-yl)vinyl group (trans configuration). It is a selective inhibitor of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), which directs the conversion of trypophan to kynurenin. It has a role as an EC 1.13.11.11 (tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase) inhibitor. It is a fluoroindole, a member of pyridines and an olefinic compound.
