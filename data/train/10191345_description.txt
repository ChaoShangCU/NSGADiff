The molecule is a quercetin O-glucoside that consists of quercetin attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 and a alpha-L-6'''-p-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antioxidant. It is a quercetin O-glucoside and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid.
