The molecule is a member of the class of benzofurans that is a heterodimer of feruloylagmatine and para-coumarylagmatine where the former's hydroxy group has reacted across the latter's ethene double bond resulting in oxidative coupling to form a furan ring. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a member of guanidines, a member of benzofurans, a dicarboxylic acid diamide, a member of phenols and an aromatic ether. It derives from a feruloylagmatine and a p-coumaroylagmatine.
