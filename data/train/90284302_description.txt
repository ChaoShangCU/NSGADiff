The molecule is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2,2-dimethyl-3-[(1Z)-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-en-1-yl]cyclopropanecarboxylic acid with the hydroxy group of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(methoxymethyl)benzyl alcohol. It is an unspecified mixture of isomers at the cyclopropane ring; the trifluoropropenyl side-chain has Z configuration. It is an insecticide with rapid knock-down activity. It has a role as a pyrethroid ester insecticide. It is a carboxylic ester, a tetrafluorobenzene and a member of cyclopropanes.
