The molecule is a guaiacyl lignin that is guaiacylglycerol in which the hydrogen on the 2-hydroxy function has been replaced by a beta-coniferyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite and a bacterial metabolite. It is a guaiacyl lignin, a monomethoxybenzene, a member of phenols, a primary alcohol and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a guaiacylglycerol and a coniferol.
