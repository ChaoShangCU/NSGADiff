The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising a linear tetrasaccharide chain of alpha-D-galactose, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (1->3), (1->4) and (1->6), to the beta-D-galactose residue of which is also linked (1->2) an alpha-L-fucose residue. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
