The molecule is an acyl-CoA oxoanion resulting from the removal of all four protons from the phosphate groups of 3-[(3aS,4S,5R,7aS)-5-hydroxy-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydroinden-4-yl]propanoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a 3-[(3aS,4S,5R,7aS)-5-hydroxy-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydroinden-4-yl]propanoyl-CoA.
