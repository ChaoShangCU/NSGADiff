The molecule is an acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carboxylic acid. It derives from a cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-hydroxycyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA(4-).
