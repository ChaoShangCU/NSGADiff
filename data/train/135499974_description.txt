The molecule is a pyochelin that has S-stereochemistry at the thioaminal centre; the diastereoisomer with R-stereochemistry at this centre is pyochelin I. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a mixture of pyochelin I (major) and pyochelin I (minor) via condensation of salicylic acid and two molecules of cysteine. The enantiomeric compounds, enant-pyochelin I and II, are produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens.
