The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid 1,1-dioxide with the exocyclic nitrogen of 2-aminopyridine. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the oxicam class, it is used to relieve pain and works by preventing the production of endogenous prostaglandins involved in the mediation of pain, stiffness, tenderness and swelling. It has a role as an analgesic, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor and an antirheumatic drug. It is a benzothiazine, a member of pyridines and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
