The molecule is a class I yanuthone that is 5,6-epoxy-cyclohex-2-en-1-one which is substituted at positions 3, 4, and 6 by methyl, acetoxy, and trans,trans-farnesyl groups, respectively (the R,R,R stereoisomer). Isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger, it shows antifungal activity towards the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (IC50 = 17.5 +-3.9 muM). It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite and an antifungal agent. It is an acetate ester and a class I yanuthone. It derives from a (2-trans,6-trans)-farnesol and a 7-deacetoxyyanuthone A.
