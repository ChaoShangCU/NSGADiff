The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine having two alpha-L-fucosyl residues at the 3- and 6-positions as well as an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue at the 4-position. It has a role as a carbohydrate allergen. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an amino tetrasaccharide. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->6)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
