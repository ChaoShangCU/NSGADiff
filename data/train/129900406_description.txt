The molecule is a medium-chain unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3E,5Z)-dodecadienoic acid. It is a (3E,5Z)-dienoyl-CoA, a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3E,5Z)-dodecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
