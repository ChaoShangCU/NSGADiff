The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside compound having a a hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) group bridging over positions 4 and 6, galloyl groups at positions 2 and 3 and a 4-hydroxyphenyl substituent at the 1-position. Isolated from Eugenia hyemalis, it exhibits inhibitory activity against HIV-1. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.1.26.13 (retroviral ribonuclease H) inhibitor. It is a beta-D-glucoside and a gallate ester. It derives from a hydroquinone O-beta-D-glucopyranoside.
