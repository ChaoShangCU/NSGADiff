The molecule is a member of the class of acrylamides that is (3R)-3-[4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-1-yl]piperidine in which the piperidine nitrogen is replaced by an acryloyl group. A selective and covalent inhibitor of the enzyme Bruton's tyrosine kinase, it is used for treatment of B-cell malignancies. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.2 (non-specific protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pyrazolopyrimidine, an aromatic amine, an aromatic ether, a member of acrylamides, a N-acylpiperidine and a tertiary carboxamide.
