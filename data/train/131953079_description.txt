The molecule is a tetrapeptide comprising in sequence an alpha-aspartyl residue, two lysyl residues and a beta-alanyl residue, to the nitrogen of the aspartyl residue of which are linked both a methyl group and a 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl moiety, while the epsilon nitrogen of the lysyl(II) residue carries a biotin moiety. It is used a peptide probe, with the biotin moiety finding application in immunoassays. It has a role as a peptide probe and a peptide allergen.
