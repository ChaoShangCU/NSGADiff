The molecule is a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid that consists of dihydro-beta-agarofuran substituted by an acetoxy groups at positions 1 and 2 and benzoyloxy groups at positions 6 and 9 (the 1beta,2beta,6alpha,9alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from Celastrus orbiculatus, it exhibits inhibition of both NF-kappaB activation and nitric oxide production. It has a role as a metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and a NF-kappaB inhibitor. It is an acetate ester, a benzoate ester, a bridged compound, a cyclic ether, a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid and an organic heterotricyclic compound.
