The molecule is an ascarosyloxycarboxylic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester resulting from the formal esterification of the carboxy group of ascr#3 with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucopyranose. It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is an ascarosyloxycarboxylic acid beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester, an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside and an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic ester. It derives from an ascr#3.
