The molecule is a gallate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of gallic acid with the (3R)-hydroxy group of epicatechin. A natural product found in Parapiptadenia rigida. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-amylase) inhibitor and an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor. It is a catechin, a gallate ester and a polyphenol. It derives from a (-)-epicatechin and a gallic acid.
