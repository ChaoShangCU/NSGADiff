The molecule is a naphtho-gamma-pyrone that is fonsecin in which the hydroxy group at position 8 (meta to the methoxy group) has been converted to the corresponding methyl ether. Found in Aspergillus fonsecaeus. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a naphtho-gamma-pyrone, an aromatic ether, a member of phenols and a cyclic hemiketal. It derives from a fonsecin.
