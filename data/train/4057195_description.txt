The molecule is a phosphonium ylide that is 2-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetamide in which the nitrogen has been converted to the corresponding carbamoyl derivative. By targeting the beta-subunit of fatty acid synthase, it inhibits nuclear envelope expansion and nuclear elongation during the closed mitosis of fission yeast. It has a role as an EC 2.3.1.85 (fatty acid synthase) inhibitor. It is a N-acylurea and a phosphonium ylide.
