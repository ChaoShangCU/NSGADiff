The molecule is a tricarboxylic acid trianion resulting from the deprotonation of all three carboxy groups of (2S,3R)-3-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a tricarboxylic acid trianion and a 3-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate. It is a conjugate base of a (2S,3R)-3-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid.
