The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is the benzoate ester obtained by the condensation of the 3-hydroxy group of 1beta-hydroxymaprounic acid with p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Isolated from Maprounea africana, it exhibits inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It has a role as a metabolite and a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is a benzoate ester, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a maprounic acid and a 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.
