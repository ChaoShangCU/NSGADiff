The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide comprising an alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactopsyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine linear trisaccharide, the central galactoside residue of which is linked to a further alpha-D-galactose residue via an alpha(1->4) glycosidic bond. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
