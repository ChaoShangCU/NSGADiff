The molecule is an ellagitannin isolated from the dried flower buds of Eugenia caryophyllata. It exhibits alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity and antiviral activity against acyclovir and phosphonoacetic acid (PAA)-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as well as the wild-type HSV-1. It has a role as an antifungal agent, an anti-HSV-1 agent, an antineoplastic agent, an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor and a metabolite. It is a lactone, a beta-D-glucoside, an ellagitannin and a gallate ester. It derives from a gallic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a tellimagrandin II(1-).
