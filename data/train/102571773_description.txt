The molecule is a polyunsaturated hydroxy fatty acid that consists of (7Z,10Z,14E,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid bearing a single hydroxy substituent at the 13R-position. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,13R,14E,16Z,19Z)-13-hydroxydocosapentaenoate.
