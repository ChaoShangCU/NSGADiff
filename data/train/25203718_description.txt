The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is chrysene which has been fully hydrogenated except for a double bond between the 12 and 12a positions and which is substituted by methyl groups at positions 1, 1, 4b, 6a, 8 and 10a positions, and by a 4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl group at position 8 (the 2S,4aS,4bR,6aS,8R,10aR,10bS-diastereoisomer). It has been isolated from the root bark of the Panamanian tree Maytenus blepharodes. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid and a secondary alcohol.
