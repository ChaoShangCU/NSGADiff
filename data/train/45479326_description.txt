The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (9Z,12Z)-hexadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,12Z)-hexadeca-9,12,15-trienoyl-CoA(4-).
