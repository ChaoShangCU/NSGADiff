The molecule is an N-(1,2-saturated acyl)sphinganine having a tetracosanoyl group attached to the nitrogen atom. It has a role as a mouse metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a N-(1,2-saturated acyl)sphinganine and a N-(very-long-chain fatty acyl)-sphingoid base. It derives from a tetracosanoic acid.
