The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is formononetin attached to a 6-O-(carboxyacetyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyisoflavone, a malonate ester, a monosaccharide derivative and a member of 4'-methoxyisoflavones. It derives from a formononetin.
