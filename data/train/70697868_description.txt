The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is irilone attached to a 6-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 4' via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Iris pseudopumila, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antioxidant. It is a glycosyloxyisoflavone, a hydroxyisoflavone and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from an irilone.
