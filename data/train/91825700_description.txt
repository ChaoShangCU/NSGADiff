The molecule is a linear amino hexasaccharide comprising two alpha-N-glycoloylneuraminyl residues, a beta-D-galactose residue, an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue, a beta-D-galactose residue and (at the reducing end) an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue, linked sequentially (2->8), (2->3), (1->4), (1->3) and (1->4). It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
