The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA resulting from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxypentanoic acid. It is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (S)-3-hydroxypentanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA(4-).
