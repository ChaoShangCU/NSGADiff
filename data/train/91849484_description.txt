The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucopyranose, 3-O-methyl-beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->2) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
