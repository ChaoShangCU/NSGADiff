The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is (2alpha,3beta,21beta)-ursa-9(11),12-diene-2,3,21,30-tetrol attached to beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues at positions 21 and 30 respectively via glycosidic linkages. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a diol and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
