The molecule is an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxylic acid group of 3-oxodecanoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a 3-oxodecanoic acid and a decanoyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-oxodecanoyl-CoA(4-).
