The molecule is a cytidine 5'-phosphate obtained by formal condensation of the phosphate group of CMP with the phosphono group of phosphonoformic acid. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a cytidine 5'-phosphate and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a phosphonoformic acid and a cytidine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a CMP-5'-phosphonoformate(3-).
