The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-dec-3-enoic acid. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-3-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a trans-dec-3-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-dec-3-enoyl-CoA(4-).
