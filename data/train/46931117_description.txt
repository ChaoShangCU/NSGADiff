The molecule is the anion formed from 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine by removal of a proton from the nitrogen at position 3 (i.e. between the oxo groups). It is the major species at physiological pH. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a cofactor. It is a conjugate base of a 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-D-ribityl)lumazine.
