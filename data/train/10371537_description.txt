The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 3,5,6,7,4'-pentahydroxyflavonol substituted by a rutinosyl group at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Daphniphyllum calycinum, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is a rutinoside, a tetrahydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone and a disaccharide derivative.
