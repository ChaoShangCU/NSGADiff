The molecule is a dipeptide that consists of beta-alanyl-L-glutamine amide bearing a 2-carboxy-4,6-dinitrophenyl (DNCP) substituent at the amino terminus while the amides at the carboxy terminus and side-chain are substituted by beta-D-glucopyranos-2-yl groups. It is a dipeptide, a C-nitro compound, a N-acyl-beta-D-glucosamine and a member of benzoic acids.
