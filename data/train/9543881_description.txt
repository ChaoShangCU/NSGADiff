The molecule is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol in which the acyl groups at positions 1 and 2 are specified as stearoyl and (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl respectively. It has a role as a protein kinase C agonist and a calcium channel agonist. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid and an octadecanoic acid.
