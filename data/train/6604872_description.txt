The molecule is a phosphonic acid in which the hydrogen attached to phosphorous is substituted by a 1-{[(7-bromo-2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin-5-yl)methyl]amino}ethyl group. Potent and selective NMDA antagonist that acts through the glycine site (IC50 = 5 nM). Displays >500-fold selectivity over kainate and AMPA receptors (IC50 values are 2.7 and 3 muM respectively). Anticonvulsant in vivo following systemic administration. It has a role as a NMDA receptor antagonist and an anticonvulsant. It is a quinoxaline derivative, an organobromine compound, a secondary amino compound and a member of phosphonic acids. It contains a CGP 78608(1+).
