The molecule is an S-conjugate in which the mercapto hydrogen of L-cysteinylglycine has been replaced by a cyano(indol-3-yl)methyl group. It is a S-conjugate, a dipeptide, a member of indoles and a nitrile. It derives from a L-cysteinylglycine and an indole-3-acetonitrile. It is a tautomer of a Cys(IAN)-Gly zwitterion.
