The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is 6,8,4'-trihydroxyflavanone attached to a 6-O-[(2E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 4' via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Leucas urticifolia, it acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor. It is a dihydroxyflavanone, a beta-D-glucoside, a cinnamate ester and a flavanone glycoside. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid.
