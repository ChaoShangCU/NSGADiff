The molecule is a lactam that is 4-hydroxyazacyclotetradecan-2-one substituted by an ethyl group at position 11, a methyl group at position 3 and a 3,6-dideoxy-3-(methylamino)-alpha-L-talopyranosyl moiety at position 4 via a glycosyl linkage (the 3R,4S,11S stereoisomer). It is isolated from the fermentation broth of Nonomuraea turkmeniaca MA7364 and exhibits anthelminthic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an anthelminthic drug. It is a lactam, a macrocycle and an aminoglycoside. It derives from a fluvirucin A1.
