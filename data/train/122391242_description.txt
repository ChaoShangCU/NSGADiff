The molecule is a dihydroxyflavone that is tricin 4'-O-(threo-beta-guaiacylglyceryl) ether in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 7 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a dimethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, a polyphenol, a monohydroxyflavone and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a 3',5'-di-O-methyltricetin and a (+)-(7S,8S)-guaiacylglycerol.
