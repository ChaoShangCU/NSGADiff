The molecule is a steroid saponin that is 17alpha-pregnenolone which is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 8, 12beta, 14beta and 17beta, in which the 14beta-hydrocy group has been acylated by formal condensation with the carboxy group of (2E)-3,4-dimethylpent-2-enoic acid, and in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been glycosylated with 2,6-dideoxy-3-O-methyl-beta-D-arabino-hexopyranosyl-(1->4)-2,6-dideoxy-3-O-methyl-beta-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1->4)-2,6-dideoxy-3-O-methyl-beta-D-ribo-hexopyranos. A C-21 steroidal glycoside, it is the essential active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine Qingyangshen, isolated from Cynanchum otophyllum and used to treat epilepsy and rheumatic pain. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an anticonvulsant. It is an 8-hydroxy steroid, a 14beta-hydroxy steroid, a 17beta-hydroxy steroid, a steroid saponin, a trisaccharide derivative and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
