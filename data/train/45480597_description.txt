The molecule is a linear pentasaccharide consisting of a beta-D-galactose residue, three L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose residues and (at the reducing end) a 3-deoxy-alpha-D-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Kdo) residue linked sequentially (1->2), (1->2), (1->3) and (1->5); the structure is that of the pentasaccharide epitope from Haemophilus influenzae MAHI 4. It has a role as an epitope.
