The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid diamide consisting of 3-aminoalanine in which the alpha-amino fuunction is acylated by a 3-carbamoyloxirane-2-carbonyl group. NB Although the relative configuration of the epoxide moiety has been assigned as trans, it has not yet been established whether the absolute configuration is R,R (as drawn) or S,S. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is an epoxide, a dicarboxylic acid diamide and a beta-amino acid. It derives from a 3-amino-L-alanine and a fumaric acid. It is a tautomer of a 3-amino-N-(trans-3-carbamoyloxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-alanine zwitterion.
