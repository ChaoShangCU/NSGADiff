The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z)-3-oxotriacontahexaenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z)-3-oxotriacontahexaenoyl-CoA(4-).
