The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and alpha-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-lactose and an alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp.
