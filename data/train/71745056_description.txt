The molecule is a nine amino acid peptide which is formed when angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) hydrolyzes the carboxy terminal leucine from angiotensin I. It is a anti-cardiac hypertrophy agent. It has a role as a human metabolite, a rat metabolite, an antihypertensive agent and a cardioprotective agent. It is a tautomer of an angiotensin (1-9) dizwitterion.
