The molecule is a FAHFA (fatty acid ester of a hydroxy fatty acid) obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of palmitic acid with the hydroxy group of 9-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (9-hydroxystearic acid). It has a role as a human metabolite, a hypoglycemic agent and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a FAHFA and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a hexadecanoic acid and an octadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 9-PAHSA(1-).
