The molecule is a member of the calss of benzofurans that is a homodimer of para-coumarylagmatine where a hydroxy group of one molecule has reacted across the other molecule's ethene double bond to combine the two molecules and form a furan ring. It has a role as a metabolite and an adrenergic antagonist. It is a member of benzofurans, a member of guanidines, a member of phenols, a dicarboxylic acid diamide and an aromatic ether. It derives from a p-coumaroylagmatine.
