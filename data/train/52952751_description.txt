The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is olean-12-ene attached to hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 23, oxo groups at positions 1 and 28 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 28. It has been isolated from the leaves and twigs of Juglans sinensis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a carboxylic ester, a monosaccharide derivative, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a beta-D-glucoside and a cyclic terpene ketone. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
