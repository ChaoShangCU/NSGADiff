The molecule is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate(2-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate OH groups of 1-stearoyl-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a 1-stearoyl-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate.
