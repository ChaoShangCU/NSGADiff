The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion that is the conjugate base of 12(S)-HPE(5,8,10)TrE, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion, a long-chain fatty acid anion, a hydroperoxy fatty acid anion, a hydroperoxyicosatrienoate and a hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acid anion. It derives from a (5Z,8Z,11Z)-icosatrienoate. It is a conjugate base of a 12(S)-HPE(5,8,10)TrE.
