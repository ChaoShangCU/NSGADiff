The molecule is a multi-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of farnesoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a multi-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a farnesoic acid and a coenzyme A.
