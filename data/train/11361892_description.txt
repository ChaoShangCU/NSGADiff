The molecule is a meroterpenoid that is 4,4,7,8a-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,8a-octahydronaphthalene substituted by a (3E)-5-(5-carboxy-2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methylpent-3-en-1-yl moiety at position 8. It is isolated from the marine sponge Acanthodendrilla and exhibits inhibitory activity against the enzyme mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (EC 2.7.11.1). It has a role as a metabolite, a protein kinase inhibitor and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a meroterpenoid, a carbobicyclic compound, a monohydroxybenzoic acid and a member of octahydronaphthalenes.
