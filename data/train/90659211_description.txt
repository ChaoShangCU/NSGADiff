The molecule is a cyclopentapyran that is (4aS,7aR)-1,4a,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrocyclopenta[c]pyran substituted at position 1 by a hydroxy group and at positions 4 and 7 by a formyl and methyl group, respectively (the 1R,4aS,7S,7aR-diastereomer). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a cyclopentapyran, a lactol, an iridoid monoterpenoid and an aldehyde. It derives from a 7-deoxyloganetic acid.
