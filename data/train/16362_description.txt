The molecule is a member of the class of benzimidazoles that is 1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a piperidin-4-yl group, which in turn is substituted on the nitrogen by a 4,4-bis(p-fluorophenyl)butyl group. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, a first generation antipsychotic, an antidyskinesia agent and a dopaminergic antagonist. It is a member of benzimidazoles, an organofluorine compound and a heteroarylpiperidine.
