The molecule is a butan-4-olide that is dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one substituted by a hydroxy group at position 4, a 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-14-phenyltetradecyl group at position 5 and a methyl group at position 5 (the 4R,5R stereoisomer). It is isolated from the Australian marine sponge Plakinastrella clathrata. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a butan-4-olide and a diol.
