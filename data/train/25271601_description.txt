The molecule is a very long-chain hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxyhexacosanoic acid. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (S)-3-hydroxyhexacosanoic acid.
