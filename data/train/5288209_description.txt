The molecule is a retinoid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of all-trans retinoic acid and the anilino group of 4-hydroxyaniline. Synthetic retinoid agonist. Antiproliferative, antioxidant and anticancer agent with a long half-life in vivo. Apoptotic effects appear to be mediated by a mechanism distinct from that of 'classical' retinoids. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an antioxidant. It is a retinoid and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from an all-trans-retinoic acid.
