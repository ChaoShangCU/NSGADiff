The molecule is a bisindole alkaloid that is quinone bearing hydroxy substituents at positions 2 and 5 and two indol-3-yl groups at positions 3 and 6, one of which is carrying a prenyl group at position 6. Isolated from the culture broth of Chrysosporium merdarium, it acts as an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease and EGF-R protein tyrosine kinase. It has a role as a metabolite, an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist and a HIV protease inhibitor. It is a bisindole alkaloid and a member of dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones.
