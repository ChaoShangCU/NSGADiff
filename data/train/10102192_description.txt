The molecule is a sterol 3-beta-D-glucoside that is 16,23-epoxycholest-24-ene-3,22-diol substituted by a 6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage (the 3beta,5beta,16beta,22R,23S stereoisomer). Isolated from bulbs of Ornithogalum saundersiae, it exhibits inhibitory activity on proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cholestanoid, a cyclic ether, a sterol 3-beta-D-glucoside, a trisaccharide derivative and a 22-hydroxy steroid.
