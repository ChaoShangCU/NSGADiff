The molecule is a phosphorylated mannosylinositol compound which constitutes the head group of some mannosylinositol phosphorylceramides (the M(IP)2Cs), and is a product of their catabolism. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It derives from a mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide. It is a conjugate acid of a mannose-(1D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate)2(3-).
