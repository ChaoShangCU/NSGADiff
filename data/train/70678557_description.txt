The molecule is an insulin that is produced in the pancreas and involved in regulating the metabolism of carbohydrates (particularly glucose) and fats. Commonly thought of as a protein, it consists of two peptide chains, one containing 21 amino acid residues and the other containing 30; the chains are joined together by 2 disulfide bonds. Recombinant insulin is identical to human insulin, but is synthesised by inserting the human insulin gene into E. coli, which then produces insulin for human use. It is used in the treatment of type I and type II diabetes. It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent.
