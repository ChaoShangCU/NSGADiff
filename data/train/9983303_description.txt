The molecule is a biaryl resulting from the formal oxidative coupling of the 6 position of 3-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,2-benzoxazole with the 3 position of p-toluic acid and subsequent condensation of the carboxy group with the primary amino group of 3-(morpholin-4-yl)aniline to give the corresponding carboxamide. An inhibitor of p38-alpha MAP kinase. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.24 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor. It is a biaryl, a member of morpholines, a member of benzamides, a member of 1,2-benzoxazoles, a member of piperidines and a secondary amino compound.
