The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is primulagenin A attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a diol and a trisaccharide derivative. It derives from a primulagenin A. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
