The molecule is a lignan that is (2R)-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-2-ylmethanol which is substituted by a 2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)ethenyl group at position 6 and a 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl group at position 3. It is a stilbenolignan isolated from the seeds of Aiphanes aculeata and exhibits potent inhibitory efficacy against cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2). It has a role as an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a stilbenoid, a lignan, an aromatic ether and a benzodioxine.
