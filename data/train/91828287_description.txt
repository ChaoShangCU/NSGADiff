The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-oxooleic acid. It is a long-chain 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an oleic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-oxooleoyl-CoA(4-).
