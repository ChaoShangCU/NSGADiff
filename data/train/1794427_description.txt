The molecule is a cinnamate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of trans-caffeic acid with the 3-hydroxy group of quinic acid. It is an intermediate metabolite in the biosynthesis of lignin. It has a role as a plant metabolite and a food component. It is a cinnamate ester and a tannin. It derives from a (-)-quinic acid and a trans-caffeic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a chlorogenate.
