The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,9Z)-hexadecadienoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,9Z)-hexadecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
