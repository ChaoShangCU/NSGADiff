The molecule is a glycosyl alditol derivative consisting of beta-D-galactopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose and N-acetyl-D-galactosaminitol residues joined in sequence by (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is a glycosyl alditol derivative and a member of acetamides. It derives from a N-acetyl-D-galactosaminitol and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
