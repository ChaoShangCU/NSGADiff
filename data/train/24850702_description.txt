The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is the cinnamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of trans-4-coumaric acid with D:C-friedoolean-7,9(11)-dien-3beta-ol-29-oic acid. It is isolated from the stems of Lagenaria siceraria and exhibits cytotoxic activity against human hepatoma SK-Hep 1 cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a monocarboxylic acid and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid and a D:C-friedoolean-7,9(11)-dien-3beta-ol-29-oic acid.
