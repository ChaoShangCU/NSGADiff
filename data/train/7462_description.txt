The molecule is one of three isomeric monoterpenes differing in the positions of their two double bonds (beta- and gamma-terpinene being the others). In alpha-terpinene the double bonds are at the 1- and 3-positions of the p-menthane skeleton. It has a role as a volatile oil component and a plant metabolite. It is a monoterpene and a cyclohexadiene.
