The molecule is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide that is 3',5'-cyclic GMP in which the hydrogen at position 2 on the purine fragment is replaced by a 4-chlorophenylthio group. It has a role as a protein kinase agonist. It is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide, a ribonucleotide, an aryl sulfide and an organochlorine compound. It derives from a 3',5'-cyclic GMP. It is a conjugate acid of an 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP(1-).
