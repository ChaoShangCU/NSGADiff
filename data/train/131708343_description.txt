The molecule is an L-isoleucine derivative resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (3R)-jasmonic acid with the amino group of L-isoleucine. It is a N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid, a L-isoleucine derivative and a fatty amide. It is a conjugate acid of a N-[(3R)-jasmonyl]-L-isoleucinate.
