The molecule is an ergostanoid that is (5alpha)-ergosta-8,24(28)-diene substituted by hydroxy groups a positions 3 and 11 and an oxo group at position 7 (the 3beta,11alpha stereoisomer). It has been isolated from Aspergillus ochraceus. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, an 11alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 7-oxo steroid and an ergostanoid. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-ergostane.
