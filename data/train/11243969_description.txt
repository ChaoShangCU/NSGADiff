The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2S)-amino(3-hydroxyadamantan-1-yl)acetic acid with the amino group of (1S,3S,5S)-2-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-3-carbonitrile. Used in its monohydrate form for the treatment of Type II diabetes. It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent and an EC 3.4.14.5 (dipeptidyl-peptidase IV) inhibitor. It is a member of adamantanes, a nitrile, an azabicycloalkane, a tertiary alcohol and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
