The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is dammer-25-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 20 and 24 and an oxo group at position 3 (the 24S-stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the stems of Aglaia abbreviata. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a cyclic terpene ketone and a diol. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
