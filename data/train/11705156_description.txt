The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is 5alpha-lanosta-8,24-diene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 26 and oxo groups at positions 3 and 7. Isolated from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma pfeifferi, it exhibits against herpes simplex virus. It has a role as a metabolite and an anti-HSV-1 agent. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a diketone and a primary alcohol. It derives from a hydride of a lanostane.
