The molecule is a pteridine that is lumazine substituted with a 1,2-dideoxy-1-D-ribityl group at position 8 and a methyl group at position 7; one of 20 modifications to the potent microbial riboflavin-based metabolite antigen 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribityl aminouracil (5-OP-RU), an activator of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells when presented by the MR1 protein (reported in MED:32123373). It derives from a lumazine and a ribitol.
