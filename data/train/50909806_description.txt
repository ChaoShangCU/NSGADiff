The molecule is a branched heptasaccharide derivative consisting of two repeating units of beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fuc-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcNAc (joined by a (1->3)-linkage) with an alpha-L-fucosyl residue attached at the 2-position of the galactose residue at the non-reducing end. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a heptasaccharide derivative.
