The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4 have each been glycosylated by a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-D-Galp and a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-D-Galp.
