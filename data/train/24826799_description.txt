The molecule is a benzamide obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 3-(imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methylbenzoic acid with the anilino group of 4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is a N-methylpiperazine, a member of benzamides, an acetylenic compound, an imidazopyridazine and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes.
