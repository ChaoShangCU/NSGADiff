The molecule is a viscumneoside that is homoeriodictyol in which the hydroxy group at position 7 has been converted into the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranoside, the 2-hydroxy group of which has been converted to its beta-D-apiofuranoside derivative. Found in Viscum coloratum, an evergreen hemiparasitic plant whose stems and leaves are used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatism. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a viscumneoside, a flavanone glycoside and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a beta-D-apiose and a homoeriodictyol.
