The molecule is a monosaccharide derivative that is (R)-isoflavan substituted by a hydroxy group substituted at position 2', methoxy groups at positions 3' and 4' and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 7 respectively. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a member of hydroxyisoflavans, a methoxyisoflavan and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a hydride of a (R)-isoflavan.
