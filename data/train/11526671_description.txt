The molecule is a carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the primary amino group of 4-propanoyl-1,3-thiazol-2-amine with the carboxy group of a 3-phenylbutiyric acid which has been substituted at position 2 by a (4R)-4-[p-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2,5-dioxoimidazolidin-1-yl group. It is a potent, highly selective inhibitormitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 inhibitor. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.24 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an imidazolidine-2,4-dione, an aromatic ketone and a secondary carboxamide.
