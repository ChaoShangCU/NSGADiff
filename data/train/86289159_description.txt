The molecule is a methyl glycoside that is alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc (Le(x)) in which the galactose 4-OH is replaced by fluorine and the hydroxy group at the reducing-end anomeric centre is methylated. It is a methyl glycoside and a trisaccharide derivative. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
