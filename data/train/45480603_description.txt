The molecule is the monosodium salt of cilastatin. It is an inhibitor of dehydropeptidase I (membrane dipeptidase, 3.4.13.19), an enzyme found in the brush border of renal tubes and responsible for degrading the antibiotic imipenem. Cilastatin sodium is therefore administered with imipenem to prolong the antibacterial effect of the latter by preventing its renal metabolism to microbiologically inactive and potentially nephrotoxic products. It has a role as a protease inhibitor and an EC 3.4.13.19 (membrane dipeptidase) inhibitor. It contains a cilastatin(1-).
