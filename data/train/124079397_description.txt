The molecule is a linear tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of N-acetyl-alpha-D-mannosaminyl, N-acetyl-alpha-L-fucosaminyl, N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl and alpha-D-galactosyl residues linked sequentially (1->3), (1->3) and (1->4), and at the reducing end linked glycosidically to a 5-aminopentyl group. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
