The molecule is a pyrazole that is 1H-pyrazole bearing three 4-hydroxyphenyl substituents at positions 1, 3 and 5 as well as a propyl substituent at position 4. Potent, subtype-selective estrogen receptor agonist (EC50 ~ 200 pM); displays 410-fold selectivity for ERalpha over ERbeta. Prevents ovariectomy-induced weight gain and loss of bone mineral density, and induces gene expression in the hypothalamus following systemic administration in vivo. It has a role as an estrogen receptor agonist. It is a member of pyrazoles and a member of phenols.
