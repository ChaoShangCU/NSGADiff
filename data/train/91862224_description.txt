The molecule is an amino disaccharide that is 2-acetamido-3-O-sulfo-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 6 has been converted into the corresponding 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranoside. It is an amino disaccharide, a member of acetamides and an oligosaccharide sulfate. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-GalpNAc.
