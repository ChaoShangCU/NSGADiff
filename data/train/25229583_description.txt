The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-oxotetracosanoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 3-oxotetracosanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-oxotetracosanoyl-CoA(4-).
