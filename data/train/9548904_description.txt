The molecule is a lignan that is tetrahydrofuran substituted by methyl groups at positions 3 and 4 (relatively trans configuration), a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl moiety at position 5 (relatively trans to the methyl group at position 4) and a 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl group at position 2 (relatively cis to the methyl group at position 3). Isolated from the aerial parts of Piper futokadsura, it exhibits inhibitory activity against production of nitric oxide (NO). It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a lignan, a member of methoxybenzenes, a member of oxolanes and a member of phenols.
