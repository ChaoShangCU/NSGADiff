The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of a linear trisaccharide derivative of alpha-L-fucose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and (at the reducing end) alpha-D-mannose residues linked sequentially (1->4) and (1->2), to the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue of which is also linked (1->3) a beta-D-galactose residue. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
