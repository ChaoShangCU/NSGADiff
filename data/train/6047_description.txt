The molecule is an optically active form of dopa having L-configuration. Used to treat the stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control of Parkinson's disease It has a role as a prodrug, a hapten, a neurotoxin, an antiparkinson drug, a dopaminergic agent, an antidyskinesia agent, an allelochemical, a plant growth retardant, a human metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a dopa, a L-tyrosine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate acid of a L-dopa(1-). It is an enantiomer of a D-dopa. It is a tautomer of a L-dopa zwitterion.
