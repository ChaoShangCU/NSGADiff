The molecule is an enamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid with the secondary amino group of (2S,5R)-1,2,5-trimethylpiperazine. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a N-acylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, an enamide, an alkaloid and a tertiary carboxamide. It derives from a (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid.
