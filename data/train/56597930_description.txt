The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is (3beta)-3-hydroxy-13,28-epoxyoleanan-16-one attached to a tetrasaccharide residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a cyclic ether, a cyclic terpene ketone and a tetrasaccharide derivative. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
