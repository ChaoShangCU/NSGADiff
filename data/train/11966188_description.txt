The molecule is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a hydroxybutanoyl-CoA and a methylbutanoyl-CoA. It derives from a butyryl-CoA and a 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-CoA(4-).
