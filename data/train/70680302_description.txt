The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of alpha-KDN, beta-D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues linked sequentially (2->3) and (1->4), with an alpha-L-fucose residue linked (1->3) to the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine at the reducing end. It has a role as an epitope. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an amino tetrasaccharide.
