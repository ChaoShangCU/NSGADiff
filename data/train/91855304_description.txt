The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine in which the hydroxy group at position 3 of the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine moiety has been converted to the corresponding alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl derivative. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and an alpha-L-arabinopyranose.
