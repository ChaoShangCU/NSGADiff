The molecule is an aminopentasaccharide that is 2-acetamido-D-alactitol which has been glycosylated at positions 3 and 6 by 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl and alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->3)-[beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->4)]-2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl groups, respectively. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
