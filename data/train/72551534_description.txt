The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (23Z,26Z,29Z,32Z,35Z)-octatriacontapentaenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (23Z,26Z,29Z,32Z,35Z)-octatriacontapentaenoyl-CoA.
