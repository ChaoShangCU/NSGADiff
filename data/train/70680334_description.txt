The molecule is a branched amino nonasaccharide comprised of a sequence of N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues linked (1->4), (1->4), (1->3), (1->4), (1->3) and (1->4), with alpha-L-fucosyl residues linked (1->3) both to the N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine residue at the reducing end and the one proximal to it in the sequence. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino nonasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
