The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol attached to a 6-O-[(2E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a cinnamate ester, a trihydroxyflavone and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a kaempferol and a trans-4-coumaric acid.
