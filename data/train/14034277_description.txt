The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is myricetin 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside] in which the hydroxy group at position 6 of the glucosyl group has been acylated by a caffeoyl [(1E)-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-oxoprop-1-en-3-yl] group. It derives from a myricetin 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside]. It is a conjugate acid of a myricetin 3-O-[(6-O-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-alpha-L-rhamnoside](1-).
