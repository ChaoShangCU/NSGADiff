The molecule is an L-valine derivative that is L-valinamide in which alpha-amino group has been acylated by a [(2-isopropyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)methyl]methylcarbamoyl group and in which a hydrogen of the carboxamide amino group has been replaced by a (2R,4S,5S)-4-hydroxy-1,6-diphenyl-5-{[(1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethoxy)carbonyl]amino}hexan-2-yl group. A CYP3A inhibitor and antiretroviral drug from the protease inhibitor class used to treat HIV infection and AIDS, it is often used as a fixed-dose combination with another protease inhibitor, lopinavir. Also used in combination with dasabuvir sodium hydrate, ombitasvir and paritaprevir (under the trade name Viekira Pak) for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection as well as cirrhosis of the liver. It has a role as an antiviral drug, a HIV protease inhibitor, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a L-valine derivative, a carbamate ester, a member of ureas and a carboxamide.
