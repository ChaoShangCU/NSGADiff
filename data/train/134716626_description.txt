The molecule is a benzoate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of acetylsalicylic acid with the phenolic hydroxy group of 2-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-fluorophenol. The latter is a fluorophore which is to the aspirin moiety via an H2O2-responsive bond. It can be used as probe for imaging H2O2 (overproduction of H2O2 causes oxidative stress and is characteristic of vascular diseases). In contrast to arylboronat-based probes, it shows high specificity for H2O2 over peroxynitrite (which is much more reactive than H2O2, but exists at much lower abundance). It has a role as a pharmaceutical. It is a benzoate ester, a member of benzothiazoles, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a member of salicylates. It derives from an acetylsalicylic acid and a 2-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-fluorophenol.
