The molecule is a member of the class of benzamides that is 2-aminobenzoic acid in which the hydrogen atom of the carboxy group has been substituted by a [(1S)-1-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropyl]nitrilo group and in which one of the the hydrogens of the amino group has been substituted by a (2R)-2-aminopropanoyl group. It is a metabolite isolated from the endophytic fungus, Fusarium chlamydosporium. It has a role as an antifungal agent, a fungal metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of benzamides, an organic hydroxy compound, a thiol, a secondary carboxamide and a primary amino compound. It derives from a D-alanine.
