The molecule is a metallochlorin that is heme d in which the hydroxy group and the carboxy group of the 6-carboxyethyl substituent have undergone intramolecular condensation to afford the corresponding gamma-spirolactone. It is a ferroheme, a gamma-lactone, an azaspiro compound, an oxaspiro compound, a tertiary alcohol, a monocarboxylic acid and a metallochlorin. It derives from a heme d cis-diol. It is a conjugate acid of a cis-heme d hydroxychlorin gamma-spirolactone(1-).
