The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is cucurbita-1,5-diene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 16, 20 and 25, a methoxy group at position 24, oxo groups at positions 3, 11 and 22 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy residue at position 2. It has been isolated from the roots of Machilus yaoshansis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a triterpenoid saponin, a cucurbitacin and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
