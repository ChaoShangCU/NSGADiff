The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is luteolin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 4' via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from Olea europaea. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a trihydroxyflavone. It derives from a luteolin.
