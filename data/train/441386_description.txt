The molecule is the monomethanesulfonic acid salt of delavirdine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with activity specific for HIV-1. Viral resistance emerges rapidly when delavirdine is used alone, so it is therefore used (as the methanesulfonic acid salt) with other antiretrovirals for combination therapy of HIV infection. It has a role as an antiviral drug and a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It contains a delavirdine.
