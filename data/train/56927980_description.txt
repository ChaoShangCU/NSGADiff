The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide comprised of two N-acetylated glucosamine residues sulfated on O-6, and three galactosyl residues, of which one is at the reducing end and another is at the non-reducing end. It is an intermediate in the keratan sulfate degradation pathway. It has a role as a mouse metabolite.
