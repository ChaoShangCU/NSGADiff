The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide compound consisting of the linear trisaccharide beta-D-mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in which the mannosyl residue has a beta-D-xylosyl residue attached at position 2 as well as two alpha-D-mannosyl residues at positions 3 and 6. It has a role as a carbohydrate allergen. It is an amino hexasaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a high-mannose oligosaccharide.
