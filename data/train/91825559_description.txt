The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is lupan-30-al with a hydroxy substituent at position 28 and an oxo group at position 3 (the 20R stereoisomer). Isolated from Acacia mellifera, it exhibits cytotoxicity activity against the NSCLC-N6 cell line, derived from a human non-small-cell bronchopulmonary carcinoma. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a primary alcohol and an aldehyde. It derives from a hydride of a lupane.
