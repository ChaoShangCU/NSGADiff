The molecule is an amino oligosaccharide in which an alpha-L-fucosyl residue is linked (1->2) to the mannosyl residue furthest from the reducing end of an alpha-D-GalNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc linear heptasaccharide. It is a galactosamine oligosaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an amino oligosaccharide.
