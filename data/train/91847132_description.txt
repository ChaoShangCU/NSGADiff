The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide consisting of a 6-O-[(2-aminoethoxy)(hydroxy)phosphoryl-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl residue, two alpha-D-mannopyranosyl residues, and a 2-amino-alpha-D-glucose residue linked together in sequence by (1->2), (1->6) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an oligosaccharide phosphate and an amino tetrasaccharide.
