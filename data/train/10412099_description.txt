The molecule is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid that is the 7-O-glucuronide of (2S)-eriodictyol. Isolated from the flowers of Chrysanthemum indicum, it exhibits inhibitory activity for rat lens aldose reductase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, a member of 3'-hydroxyflavanones, a trihydroxyflavanone and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from an eriodictyol.
