The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc.
