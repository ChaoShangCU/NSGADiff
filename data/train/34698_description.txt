The molecule is a furonaphthodioxole that is a synthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin with anti-tumour activity; causes single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA and DNA-protein cross-links and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor. It is a furonaphthodioxole, a gamma-lactone, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of thiophenes, an aromatic ether, a member of phenols and a cyclic acetal. It derives from a podophyllotoxin.
