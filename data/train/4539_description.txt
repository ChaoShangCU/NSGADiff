The molecule is a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Norfloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase. It has a role as an antibacterial drug, a DNA synthesis inhibitor, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid, a N-arylpiperazine, a quinolone, a quinolone antibiotic and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
