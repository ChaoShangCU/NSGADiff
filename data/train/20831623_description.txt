The molecule is a beta-caryophyllene in which the stereocentre adjacent to the exocyclic double bond has R configuration while the remaining stereocentre has S configuration. It is the enantiomer of (-)-beta-caryophyllene, which occurs much more widely than the (+)-form. It has a role as a metabolite. It is an enantiomer of a (-)-beta-caryophyllene.
