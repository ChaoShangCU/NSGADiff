The molecule is an oxo fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxylic acid group of (9S,13S)-1a,1b-dinor-12-oxo-10,15-phytodienoic acid. It is an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 6-{(1S,5S)-4-oxo-5-[(2Z)-pent-2-en-1-yl]cyclopent-2-en-1-yl}hexanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9S,13S)-1a,1b-dinor-12-oxo-10,15-phytodienoyl-CoA(4-).
