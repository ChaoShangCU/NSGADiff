The molecule is an alkaloid ester obtained by formal condensation of the hydroxy group of cystodytin E with the carboxy group of elaidic acid. It is isolated from the Okinawan marine tunicate Cystodytes dellechiajei and exhibits cytotoxicity against human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an alkaloid ester, an enamide, an enone, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a tiglic acid, an elaidic acid and a cystodytin E.
