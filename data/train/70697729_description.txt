The molecule is a steroid saponin that consists of (3beta,22R)-22-methoxyfurostan-3,26-diol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 26 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1->3)]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Brunfelsia grandiflora, it exhibits antileishmanial activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antileishmanial agent. It derives from a hydride of a furostan.
