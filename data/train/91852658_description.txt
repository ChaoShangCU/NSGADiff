The molecule is a linear amino pentasaccharide comprising D-glucose at the reducing end with a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galactosyl moiety at the 4-position. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
