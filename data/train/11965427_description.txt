The molecule is an N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-[2-(1-benzofuran-6-carbonyl)]-5,7-dichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-6-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 3-(methanesulfonyl)-L-phenylalanine. Used for treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug and a lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 antagonist. It is a L-phenylalanine derivative, a sulfone, a N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid, a member of isoquinolines and a member of 1-benzofurans.
