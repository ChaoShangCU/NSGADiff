The molecule is a naphthopyran that is 1H-naphtho[2,3-c]pyran-5,10-diol in which the hydroxy group at position 5 (furthest from the pyran oxygen) has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucoside, while that at position 10 has been converted to the corresponding 6-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside (beta-D-quinovoside). It was isolated from the flowered aerial parts of the annual plant Mitracarpus scaber. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a naphthopyran and a beta-D-glucoside.
