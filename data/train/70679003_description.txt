The molecule is a branched amino nonasaccharide comprised of a chain of three (1->4)-linked beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl disaccharide units, onto each N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue of which is (1->3)-linked an alpha-L-fucose residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino nonasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
