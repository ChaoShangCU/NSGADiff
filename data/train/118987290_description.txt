The molecule is an L-lysine derivative in which the alpha-amino nitrogen of the amino acid has entered into amide formation with acetic acid and the epsilon-amino nitrogen carries a 1,4-dihydroxynonan-3-yl substituent. It has been synthesised by reaction of (E)-4-hydroxynon-2-enal (HNE) with N(2)-acetyl-L-lysine, the epsilon amino group of lysine reacting with the double bond function of HNE via formation of a Michael adduct.
