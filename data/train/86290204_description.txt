The molecule is a FAHFA obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of palmitic acid with the hydroxy group of 13-hydroxystearic acid. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent, a human metabolite and a hypoglycemic agent. It is a FAHFA and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a hexadecanoic acid and an octadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 13-PAHSA(1-).
