The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z)-triacontapentaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z)-triacontapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z)-triacontapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
