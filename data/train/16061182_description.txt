The molecule is an N-(polyunsaturated fatty acyl)ethanolamine obtained by formal epoxidation across the 8,9-double bond of anandamide. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine, a N-(polyunsaturated fatty acyl)ethanolamine, an endocannabinoid and an epoxide. It derives from an anandamide and an 8,9-EET.
