The molecule is a member of the class xanthones which consists of a dihydroxanthone skeleton substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 8, a hydroxymethyl group at position 6 and a methoxycarbonyl group at position 4a (the 4R,4aS stereoisomer). It is isolated from Penicillium and exhibits potent antitumour activity against both human and murine tumour cell lines. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an antineoplastic agent and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a member of phenols, a member of benzyl alcohols, a member of xanthones and a methyl ester.
