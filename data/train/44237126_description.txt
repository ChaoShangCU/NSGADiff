The molecule is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (R)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (R)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (R)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoyl-CoA(4-).
