The molecule is an amino hexasaccharide comprising beta-D-glucose, N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, alpha-D-glucose, N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine and alpha-D-mannose residues in (1->3), (1->4), (1->4) and (1->3) sequence, to the N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine residue contiguous to the reducing-end mannose residue of which is also linked (1->3) a further beta-D-glucose residue.
