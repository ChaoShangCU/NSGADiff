The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of alpha-D-galactopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl and D-mannopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->2) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
