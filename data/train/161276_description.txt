The molecule is an iridoid monoterpenoid that is acetaldehyde in which on of the hydrogens of the methyl group has been replaced by a 2-(beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-4-yl group which is substituted at positions 3 and 5 by a vinyl and a methoxycarbonyl group, respectively (the 2S,3R,4S stereoisomer). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a methyl ester, an aldehyde, an enoate ester, a secoiridoid glycoside and a member of pyrans.
