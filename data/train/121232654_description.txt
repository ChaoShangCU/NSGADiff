The molecule is a guaiacyl lignin that is ferulic acid in which the phenolic hydrogen is replaced by a sulfoguaiacylglycerol group. It is found in Arabidopsis thaliana. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an alkyl sulfate, a guaiacyl lignin, a methoxycinnamic acid, a primary alcohol and a member of guaiacols. It derives from a ferulic acid and a guaiacylglycerol.
