The molecule is a member of the class of enamides obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-benzamido-3-phenylprop-2-enoic acid with the aromatic amino group of 2-[(4-aminophenyl)sulfanyl]propanoic acid, the carboxy group of which has also undergone formal condensation with the amino group of 5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxyaniline. It is a member of benzamides, an enamide, an aryl sulfide, a dimethoxybenzene, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a substituted aniline and a secondary carboxamide.
