The molecule is a thiadiazolopyridazine that is 3-iminotetrahydro[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,4-a]pyridazin-1-one in which the exocyclic nitrogen has been substituted by a 5-[(carboxymethyl)thio]-4-chloro-2-fluorophenyl group. A protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor, it is used (usually as the corresponding methyl ester proherbicide, fluthiacet-methyl) for the control of broad-leaved weeds in crops such as maize and soya. It has a role as an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is an organic sulfide, a monocarboxylic acid, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a thiadiazolopyridazine.
