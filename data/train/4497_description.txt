The molecule is a dihydropyridine that is 1,4-dihydropyridine which is substituted by methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, a (2-methoxyethoxy)carbonyl group at position 3, a m-nitrophenyl group at position 4, and an isopropoxycarbonyl group at position 5. An L-type calcium channel blocker, it acts particularly on cerebral circulation, and is used both orally and intravenously for the prevention and treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial aneurysm. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, a calcium channel blocker, a vasodilator agent and a cardiovascular drug. It is a dihydropyridine, a C-nitro compound, a diester, a member of dicarboxylic acids and O-substituted derivatives, a 2-methoxyethyl ester and an isopropyl ester.
