The molecule is a oxodocosahexaenoic acid that consists of (4Z,8E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying an oxo substituent at position 7. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is an oxodocosahexaenoic acid and an enone. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (4Z,8E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-7-oxodocosahexaenoate.
