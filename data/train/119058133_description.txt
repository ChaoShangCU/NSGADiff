The molecule is a branched tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of an alpha-D-mannosyl residue glycosidically linked to a 5-aminopentyl group and which carries at O-2 an alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl disaccharide unit and at O-4 a beta-D-galactosyl residue. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
