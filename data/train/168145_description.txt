The molecule is a seven-membered oligopeptide comprising Arg, Pro, Pro, Gly, Phe, Ser, and Pro residues joined in sequence by peptide bonds. It is a metabolite of bradykinin lacking the Phe residue at position 8 and the Arg residue at position 9. It has a role as a human metabolite and a rat metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a [des-Phe(8), des-Arg(9)]-bradykinin(1+).
