The molecule is a monohydroxybenzoic acid that is 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in which the hydrogens at positions 3 and 5 are substituted by a methoxy and a decaprenyl group. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a methoxybenzoic acid, a monohydroxybenzoic acid and a member of phenols. It derives from a 3-decaprenyl-4,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-decaprenyl-4-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoate.
