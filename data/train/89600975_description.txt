The molecule is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 4-methylpentanoic acid. It is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA and a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an isocaproic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-methylpentanoyl-CoA(4-).
