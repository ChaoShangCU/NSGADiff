The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprising a linear chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose and N-acetylbeta-D-glucosamine, all linked (1->3), with an alpha-L-fucose residue (1->4)-linked to each N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
