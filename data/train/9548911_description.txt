The molecule is an iridoid monoterpenoid that is cyclopentene substituted by a formyl group at position 3, a hydroxymethyl group at position 2, 3-oxopropen-2yl group at position 4 and a cis-4-coumaroyloxy moiety at position 1 (the 1S,4R stereoisomer). Isolated from the leaves of Viburnum luzonicum, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an aldehyde, a cinnamate ester, an iridoid monoterpenoid and a member of phenols. It derives from a cis-4-coumaric acid.
