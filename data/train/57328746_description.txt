The molecule is a serine derivative that is L-serine in which the hydroxyl hydrogen is replaced by a ureido group. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a member of ureas, a L-serine derivative and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a L-serine. It is a tautomer of an O-ureido-L-serine zwitterion.
