The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is calycosin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position at 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It is a hydroxyisoflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of 4'-methoxyisoflavones and a 7-hydroxyisoflavones 7-O-beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a calycosin.
