The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside that is the 2-azidoethyl glycoside of a tetrasaccharide (Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 tetrasaccharide) consisting of at the reducing end an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue to which are linked (1->4) and (1->6) respectively a beta-D-glucose residue and a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl disaccharide unit. It has a role as an antigen. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an azide and a tetrasaccharide derivative.
