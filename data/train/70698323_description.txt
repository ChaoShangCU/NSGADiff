The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of a linear sequence of N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl and beta-D-galactosyl residues, linked (2->3), (1->4) and (1->3), to the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue of which is also linked (1->3) an alpha-L-fucosyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
