The molecule is a 17-oxo steroid that is andrastin C in which a hydrogen of the methyl group at position 19 has been replaced by a hydroxy group. A farnesyltransferase inhibitor produced by Penicillium roqueforti, a filamentous fungus involved in the ripening of several kinds of blue cheeses. It has a role as an EC 2.5.1.58 (protein farnesyltransferase) inhibitor and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a 5beta steroid, an acetate ester, a 17-oxo steroid, a 15-hydroxy steroid, an enol, a 19-hydroxy steroid, a methyl ester, a meroterpenoid and a primary alcohol. It derives from an andrastin C. It is a conjugate acid of an andrastin B(1-).
