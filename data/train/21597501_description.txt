The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion that is the trianion of (2E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate arising from deprotonation of the three OH groups of the diphosphate. It has a role as an epitope and a phosphoantigen. It is a conjugate base of a (2E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate.
