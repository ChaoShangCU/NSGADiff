The molecule is a steroid saponin that is 4-methylergosta-7,24(28)-dien-21-oic acid attached to an acetyloxy group at position 2, and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy group at position 3 (the 2alpha,3beta,4alpha,5alpha stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the roots of Breynia fruticosa. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a steroid acid, a deoxymannose derivative, a steroid ester, a steroid saponin, an acetate ester and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from an alpha-L-rhamnopyranose.
