The molecule is a fatty acid ethyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2E,4E)-deca-2,4-dienoic acid with the hydroxy group of ethanol. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a flavouring agent, a fragrance and a kairomone. It derives from a (2E,4E)-deca-2,4-dienoic acid.
