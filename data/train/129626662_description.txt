The molecule is an epoxy(hydroxy)icosatrienoate that is the conjugate base of 20-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid function; major species at pH 7.3. It is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid anion, a hydroxy fatty acid anion, an icosanoid anion and a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion. It derives from an 11,12-EET(1-). It is a conjugate base of an 11,12-epoxy-20-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-icosatrienoic acid.
