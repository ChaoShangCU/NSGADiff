The molecule is an enone that is cyclohex-2-en-1-one substituted by a hydroxy group at position 4, methoxy groups at positions 2 and 3, a methyl group at position 6 and a (2E,6E)-3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-2,6,10-trien-1-yl group at position 5 (the 4R,5R,6R stereoisomer). It is isolated from the solid-state fermented mycelium of the fungus Antrodia camphorata and has been found to exhibit potent cytotoxicity against a number of human cancer cell lines. However, a synthesis-enabled biological re-examination published in 2016, revealed minimal in vitro and in vivo antitumour activity in preclinical models. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a fungal metabolite. It is an enone, a secondary alcohol and an enol ether.
