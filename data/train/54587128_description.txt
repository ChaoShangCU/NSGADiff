The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin with 3,16-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid as the aglycone. Isolated from the stems of Gordonia chrysandra, it exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a triterpenoid saponin and a carboxylic ester. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
