The molecule is a HPETE in which the hydroperoxy group is located at position 8S and the four double bonds at position 5, 9, 11 and 14 (the 5Z,9E,11Z,14Z-geoisomer). It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from an icosa-5,9,11,14-tetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an 8(S)-HPETE(1-). It is an enantiomer of an 8(R)-HPETE.
