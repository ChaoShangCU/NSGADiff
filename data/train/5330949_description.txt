The molecule is a carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the primary amino group of 5-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-3-amine with the carboxy group of (2S)-2-phenylpropanoic acid in which the phenyl ring is substituted at the para position by a 2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl group. A CDK2 inhibitor with antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones, a member of pyrazoles, a member of cyclopropanes, a secondary carboxamide and a tertiary carboxamide.
