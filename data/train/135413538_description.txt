The molecule is a morpholine derivative that is the (1R)-1-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethyl ether of (3-{[(2R,3S)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-hydroxymorpholin-4-yl]methyl}-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)phosphonic acid. It has a role as an antiemetic, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist and a prodrug. It is a member of morpholines, a member of triazoles, a cyclic acetal, a phosphoramide and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes. It is a conjugate acid of a fosaprepitant(2-).
