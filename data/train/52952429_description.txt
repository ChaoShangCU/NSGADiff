The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-13(18)-en-28-oic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3 (the 2alpha,3beta-stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the leaves of Rosa laevigata. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
