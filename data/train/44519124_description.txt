The molecule is a member of the class of carbazoles that is 9H-carbazole which is substituted by acetyl groups at positions 3 and 6, and by a 2-isopropylethyl group on the nitrogen atom (position 9). It is a modulator of histone chaperone FACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription) - interaction of CBL0137 with the FACT complex results in simultaneous NF-kappa beta suppression, Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1 (HSF1) suppression and p53 activation - and shows antitumour effects in animal models of various cancers. It has a role as a NF-kappaB inhibitor, a p53 activator, an antineoplastic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a member of carbazoles, a secondary amino compound, a tertiary amino compound, an aromatic ketone and a methyl ketone.
