The molecule is a glycoside consisting of D-glyceric acid having an alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-glucosyl residue at the 2-position and a phospho group at the 3-position It is a glycoside, a carboxyalkyl phosphate and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from a D-glyceric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-O-[alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-O-phosphonato-D-glycerate(3-).
