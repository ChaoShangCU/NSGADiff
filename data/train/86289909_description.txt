The molecule is a 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 5-phosphate(3-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate OH groups of 1,2-dibutyryl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'D-myo-inositol-5'-phosphate); major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a 1,2-dibutyryl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'D-myo-inositol-5'-phosphate).
