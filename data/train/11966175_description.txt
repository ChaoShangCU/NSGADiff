The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-oct-2-enoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a coenzyme A. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-oct-2-enoyl-CoA(4-).
