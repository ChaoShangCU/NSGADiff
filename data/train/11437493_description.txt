The molecule is a pyrrolidine alkaloid that is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by the formal condensation of (8E)-2-methyl-3-oxodec-8-enoic acid with (2R)-pyrrolidin-2-ylmethanol. Isolated from the the cultured broth of the fungus Penicillium citrinum, it exhibits anti-fungal and antibacterial activity. It has a role as an antibacterial agent, an antifungal agent and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a pyrrolidine alkaloid, a primary alcohol and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
