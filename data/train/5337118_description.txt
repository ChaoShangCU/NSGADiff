The molecule is an aromatic amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-furoic acid with the aromatic amino group of 4-chloro-3-([1,3]oxazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-2-yl)aniline. It has a role as a proteasome inhibitor and an antiparasitic agent. It is an oxazolopyridine, a member of furans, an aromatic amide, a ring assembly and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It derives from a 2-furoic acid.
