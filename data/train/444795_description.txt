The molecule is a retinoic acid in which all four exocyclic double bonds have E- (trans-) geometry. It has a role as a keratolytic drug, an antineoplastic agent, an antioxidant, a signalling molecule, a retinoid X receptor agonist, an anti-inflammatory agent, an AP-1 antagonist, a retinoic acid receptor agonist and a human metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of an all-trans-retinoate.
