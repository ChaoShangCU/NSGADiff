The molecule is a 3-oxo steroid that is andrastin C in which the acetoxy group at the 3beta position has undergone formal oxidative cleavage to afford the corresponding 3-oxo derivative. A farnesyltransferase inhibitor produced by Penicillium roqueforti, a filamentous fungus involved in the ripening of several kinds of blue cheeses. It has a role as a Penicillium metabolite and an EC 2.5.1.58 (protein farnesyltransferase) inhibitor. It is a 3-oxo steroid, a 15-hydroxy steroid, a 5beta steroid, a 17-oxo steroid, an enol, a meroterpenoid and a methyl ester. It is a conjugate acid of an andrastin D(1-).
