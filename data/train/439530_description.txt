The molecule is an aminonucleoside antibiotic, derived from the Streptomyces alboniger bacterium, that causes premature chain termination during translation taking place in the ribosome. It has a role as a nucleoside antibiotic, an antiinfective agent, an antineoplastic agent, a protein synthesis inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent, an EC 3.4.11.14 (cytosol alanyl aminopeptidase) inhibitor and an EC 3.4.14.2 (dipeptidyl-peptidase II) inhibitor. It is a conjugate base of a puromycin(1+).
