The molecule is a branched heptasaccharide derivative comprising one mannopyranose and six D-arabinofuranose units, in an assembly consisting of two arabinose residues linked alpha(1->5), with beta-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl and alpha-mannosyl-(1->5)-beta-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl units linked to respectively the 3- and 5-positions of the arabinose residue distal from the reducing-end residue.
