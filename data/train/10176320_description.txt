The molecule is a member of the class of isoxazoles that is L-alanine in which one of the methyl hydrogens is replaced by a 5-oxoisoxazolin-4-yl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a member of isoxazoles, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a L-alanine derivative. It is a tautomer of a 3-(5-oxoisoxazolin-4-yl)-L-alanine zwitterion.
