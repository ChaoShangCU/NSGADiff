The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z,30Z,33Z)-3-oxohexatriacontahexaenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z,30Z,33Z)-3-oxohexatriacontahexaenoyl-CoA(4-).
