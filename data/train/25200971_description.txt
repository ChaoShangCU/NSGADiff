The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid anion resulting from the removal of a proton from the carboxy group of beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta(4)-GlcpA-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc. It is a monocarboxylic acid anion, a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and a beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta(4)-GlcpA-(1->3)-D-GlcpNAc(1-). It is a conjugate base of a 3-(4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enosyluronic acid)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
