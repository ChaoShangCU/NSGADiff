The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is isovitexin in which the hydroxyl hydrogen at position 7 is replaced by a 6-sinapoylglucosyl residue. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a dihydroxyflavone, a C-glycosyl compound, a cinnamate ester and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from an isovitexin and a trans-sinapic acid.
