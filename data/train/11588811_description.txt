The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of O-phospho-D-serine with the amino group of m-octylaniline. An analogue of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), it is a potent antagonist for both S1P1 and S1P3 receptors. It can inhibit S1P-induced migration of thyroid cancer cells, ovarian cancer cells, and neural stem cells. It has a role as a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 antagonist and a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 antagonist. It is a D-serine derivative, a secondary carboxamide, an organic phosphate, a phosphoric ester and an aromatic amide. It derives from an O-phospho-D-serine.
