The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose and beta-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->4) and (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp and a beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
