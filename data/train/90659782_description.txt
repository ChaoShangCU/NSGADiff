The molecule is a steroidal acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxy-9-oxo-9,10-seco-23,24-bisnorchola-1,3,5(10)-trien-22-oic acid. It derives from a 3-hydroxy-9-oxo-9,10-seco-23,24-bisnorchola-1,3,5(10)-trien-22-oic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-hydroxy-9-oxo-9,10-seco-23,24-bisnorchola-1,3,5(10)-trien-22-oyl-CoA(4-).
