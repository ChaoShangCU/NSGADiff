The molecule is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A in which residue 1 [(2S,3R,4R,6E)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)oct-6-enoic acid] has undergone allylic oxidation to give the corresponding primary allylic alcohol, while residue 4, N-methylleucine, has undergone N-demethylation. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative and a primary allylic alcohol. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M17 and a cyclosporin A metabolite M21.
