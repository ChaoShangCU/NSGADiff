The molecule is a member of the class of azetidines that is (2S)-azetidine 2-carboxylic acid in which the carboxylic acid has been converted to the amide corresponding to formal condensation with 4-(aminomethyl)benzenecarboximidamide and in which the hydrogen attached to the azetidine nitrogen is replaced by a (2R)-2-cyclohexyl-2-[(carboxymethyl)amino]acetyl group. It has a role as an anticoagulant, an EC 3.4.21.5 (thrombin) inhibitor and a serine protease inhibitor. It is a carboxamidine, a dicarboxylic acid monoamide, a non-proteinogenic alpha-amino acid, a secondary amino compound and a member of azetidines.
