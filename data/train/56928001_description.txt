The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the n-3 PUFA and is the product of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a stearidonoyl bioconjugate. It derives from an all-cis-octadeca-6,9,12,15-tetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
