The molecule is an extended flavonoid that consists of (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5 and 3', a methoxy group at position 4' , a prenyl group at position 6 and a gem-dimethylpyran ring fused across positions 7 and 8. Isolated from Lonchocarpus utilis and Lonchocarpus urucu, it acts as a NADH:ubiquinone reductase inhibitor. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.6.5.3 [NADH:ubiquinone reductase (H(+)-translocating)] inhibitor. It is an extended flavonoid, a monomethoxyflavanone, a dihydroxyflavanone, a pyranochromane and a member of 4'-methoxyflavanones.
