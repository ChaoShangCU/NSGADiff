The molecule is a member of the class of resolvins that is (5Z,8E,10Z,13Z,15Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 7 and 17 (the 7S,17R-stereoisomer). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a resolvin, a secondary allylic alcohol, a diol and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid.
