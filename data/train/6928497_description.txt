The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid that is isobutyric acid in which a hydrogen of one of the methyl groups has been replaced by an acetylthio group (the R enantiomer). It is an important intermediate for the preparation of various angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril and alacepril. It is a monocarboxylic acid and a thioacetate ester.
