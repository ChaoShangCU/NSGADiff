The molecule is a pyrimidine nucleoside 5'-monophosphate(2-) that results from the removal of two protons from the phosphate group of UMP. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a pyrimidine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate(2-), a pyrimidine ribonucleotide, a pyrimidine ribonucleoside monophosphate and a ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate base of a uridine 5'-monophosphate.
