The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z)-dotriacontapentaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z)-dotriacontapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
