The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid sapogenin (isolated from ginseng and notoginseng) that is that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 6alpha, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a sapogenin, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a 12beta-hydroxy steroid, a 6alpha-hydroxy steroid and a 3beta-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylsteroid. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
