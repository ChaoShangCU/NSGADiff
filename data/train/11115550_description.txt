The molecule is a macrolide antibiotic that is a semisynthetic analogue of concanamycin A, possessing an 18-membered lactone ring and a 6-membered oxane ring in which the hydroxy group at position 23 is glycosylated by a 4-O-carbamoyl-2,6-dideoxy-beta-D-arabino-hexopyranosyl residue. It is a macrolide antibiotic, a monosaccharide derivative, a carbamate ester, an enol ether, a tetrol and a semisynthetic derivative.
