The molecule is a lipid hydroperoxide, obtained by the formal substitution of a hydrogen at position 10 of (8E,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-10,12,15-trienoic acid by a hydroperoxy group (the 10S stereoisomer). It is a lipid hydroperoxide and a monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (8E,10S,12Z,15Z)-10-hydroperoxyoctadec-8,12,15-trienoate.
