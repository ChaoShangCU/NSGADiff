The molecule is a nucleobase analogue that is uracil substituted with a (1-deoxy-D-ribityl)methyl group at position 6 and a (1E)-3-oxobut-1-en-1-yl group at position 5; one of 20 modifications to the potent microbial riboflavin-based metabolite antigen 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribityl aminouracil (5-OP-RU), an activator of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells when presented by the MR1 protein (reported in MED:32123373). It has a role as an epitope. It is a nucleobase analogue and a pyrimidone. It derives from a uracil.
