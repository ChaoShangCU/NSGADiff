The molecule is an N-acyl-amino acid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 6-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid with the amino group of phenylalanine. It has a role as an Arabidopsis thaliana metabolite. It is a phenylalanine derivative, a member of hydroxyindoles, a N-acyl-amino acid and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from an indole-3-acetic acid.
