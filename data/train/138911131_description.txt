The molecule is a flavonoid oxoanion resulting from the deprotonation of the hydroxy group at position 7 of the flavonoid moiety of myricetin 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside. The major species at pH 7.3. Identified in PMID 29667287 Fig. S17, peak 8. It derives from a myricetin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside(1-). It is a conjugate base of a myricetin 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside.
