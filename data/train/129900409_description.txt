The molecule is a branched polysaccharide acid oxoanion comprised of an octasaccharide repeating unit consisting of a backbone of two glucose and two glucuronic acid residues, and a side chain of three glucose and one galactose residues. The octasaccharide is modified by two pyruvyl and one non-stoichiometric O-acetyl group, and one non-stoichiometric hydroxybutanoyl group. Note that the structure shown and its molfile represent only one of the possible substitution patterns.
