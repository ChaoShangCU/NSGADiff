The molecule is a non-proteinogenic amino acid derivative that is methyl alaninate substituted by a tert-butoxycarbonyl group at the N and a 2-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-(phenylsulfanyl)-1,2,3,4,4a,8a-hexahydro-6-quinolyl group at position 3. It is a member of quinolines, a dichlorobenzene, a methyl ester, a carbamate ester, an organic sulfide and a non-proteinogenic amino acid derivative. It contains a phenylsulfanyl group. It derives from a tert-butanol.
