The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)acetic acid with the amino group of ethanolamine. Used as a radiosensitising agent for hypoxic tumour cells. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a prodrug, an alkylating agent and a radiosensitizing agent. It is a member of imidazoles, a C-nitro compound and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from an ethanolamine.
