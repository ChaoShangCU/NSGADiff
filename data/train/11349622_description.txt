The molecule is a benzoate ester that is the diester obtained by the formal condensation of two molecules of benzoic acid with the hydroxymethyl group at position 1 and the hydroxy group at position 4 of 1-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohex-5-ene-1,2,3,4-tetrol the (1S,4R,5S,6S stereoisomer). Isolated from the leaves of Uvaria kweichowensis, it exhibits antitumour activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a benzoate ester and a triol.
