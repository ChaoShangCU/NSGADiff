The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide that is alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the beta-D-galactopyranosyl moiety has been glycosylated by an alpha-D-galactopyranosyl group. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc.
