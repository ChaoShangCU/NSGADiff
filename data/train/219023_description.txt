The molecule is an organic heteropentacyclic compound that is (5R)-8-[(6,7-difluoroquinolin-3-yl)methyl]-5-ethyl-5-hydroxy-1,4,5,8-tetrahydrooxepino[3,4-c]pyridine-3,9-dione in which position 7 of the oxepinopyridine moiety is joined to position 3 of the difluoroquinoine ring by a single bond. An E-ring modified camptothecin analogue that has greater lactone stability in plasma compared with other topoisomerase I inhibitors. It has a role as an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound, an organofluorine compound, a tertiary alcohol, an epsilon-lactone and an organonitrogen heterocyclic compound. It derives from a (R)-homocamptothecin.
