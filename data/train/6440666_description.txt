The molecule is an octahydronaphthalene that is 2,4,5,7-tetramethyloctahydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one which is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 7, a (2R)-1-hydroxybutan-2-yl group at position 3, and a (2Z)-3-hydroxyprop-2-enoyl group at position 4 (the 2S,3R,4R,4aS,5R,7R,8aS stereoisomer). Isolated from the endophytic fungus Stemphylium botryosum, it is the causal agent of leaf spot and foliage blight disease in tomatoes. Its phytotoxcity is at least 200 times greater than that of stemphyloxin II. It shows high affinity for Fe(3+) (but not Fe(2+)) ions. It has a role as a fungal metabolite, a phytotoxin and an iron chelator. It is a member of octahydronaphthalenes, a cyclic ketone, a primary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol, an enol, an alpha-hydroxy ketone, a 3-oxo aldehyde and a tetrol.
