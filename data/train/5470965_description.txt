The molecule is an organonitrogen heterocyclic antibiotic that is 2,4'-bi-1,3-thiazole substituted by an isopropyl group at position 2' and a 3,5,7-trimethoxy-4-methyl-7-oxohepta-1,5-dien-1-yl group at position 4 (the 2E,4R,5S,6E stereoisomer). It is isolated from the culture broth of myxobacterium, Cystobacter fuscus, and exhibits antifungal and cytotoxic activity. It has a role as an antifungal agent, an antineoplastic agent and a bacterial metabolite. It is an organonitrogen heterocyclic antibiotic, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an enol ether, an enoate ester, a biaryl and a methyl ester.
