The molecule is a member of the class of furans that in which the furan ring is substituted by a (2-amino-4-oxo-1,3-thiazol-5(4H)-ylidene)methyl group at position 2 and a 4,5-dimethyl-2-nitrophenyl group at position 5, and i which the amino substituent of the thiazolone has been substituted by a 3-carboxy-4-chlorophenyl group. It is a direct activator of the alpha-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, AMPK). It has a role as a protein kinase agonist. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a biaryl, a member of furans, a C-nitro compound, an aminobenzoic acid and a member of monochlorobenzenes.
