The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that is quercetin attached to a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1->2)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkages. It has been isolated from Vicia faba and Lotus edulis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a quercetin O-glycoside, an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a beta-D-galactoside and a trihydroxyflavone.
