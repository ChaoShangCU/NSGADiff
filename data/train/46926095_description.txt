The molecule is a D-ornithine derivative obtained by formal condensation of the terminal carboxy groups of two citric acid units with the two amino groups of D-ornithine. It has a role as a siderophore and a bacterial metabolite. It is a D-ornithine derivative, a pentacarboxylic acid, a tertiary alcohol and a tricarboxylic acid amide. It derives from a citric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a staphyloferrin A(5-).
