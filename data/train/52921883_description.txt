The molecule is an oxylipin that is the (14S,15S)-epoxy derivative of (5Z,8Z,10E,12E)-icosa-5,8,10,12-tetraenoic acid. It has a role as a metabolite. It is an epoxy fatty acid, a leukotriene, an oxylipin, a polyunsaturated fatty acid and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a (5Z,8Z,10E,12E)-icosatetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an eoxin A4(1-).
