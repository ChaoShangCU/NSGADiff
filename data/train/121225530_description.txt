The molecule is an epoxy hydroxyeicosapentaenoate anion arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid function of 5(S),6(S)-epoxy-18(R)-hydroxy-(7E,9E,11Z,14Z,16E)-eicosapentaenoic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid anion, an icosanoid anion, a long-chain fatty acid anion and a 5(S),6(S)-epoxy-18-hydroxy-(7E,9E,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoate. It is a conjugate base of a 5(S),6(S)-epoxy-18(R)-hydroxy-(7E,9E,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoic acid.
