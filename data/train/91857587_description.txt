The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose and beta-D-mannopyranose residues joined in sequence by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. It is a member of acetamides, an amino disaccharide and a glycosylmannose derivative. It derives from a N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine and a beta-D-mannose.
