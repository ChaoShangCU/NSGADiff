The molecule is a docosanoid that is (8E,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosapentaenooic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at positions 7 and 17. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid, a lipid hydroperoxide and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (8E,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-7,17-bis(hydroperoxy)docosapentaenoate.
