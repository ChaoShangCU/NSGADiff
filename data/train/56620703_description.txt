The molecule is an amino trisacharide that is beta-D-galacopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4 have each been converted into the corresponding 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl derivative. It is an amino trisaccharide, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-Galp and a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp.
