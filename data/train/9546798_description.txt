The molecule is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine in which the acyl substituents at positions 1 and 2 are specified as octadecanoyl and (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl respectively. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid and an octadecanoic acid. It is a tautomer of a 1-octadecanoyl-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion.
