The molecule is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid that is pyruvic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens is replaced by a 5-hydroxy-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-yl group (the 1R,2S,5R,6S stereoisomer). It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid, an epoxide, a secondary alcohol and an oxabicycloalkane. It derives from a pyruvic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-[(1R,2S,5R,6S)-5-hydroxy-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-yl]pyruvate.
