The molecule is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride that results from the formal condensation of the phosphoryl group of AMP with the carboxy group of 19-(4-hydroxyphenyl)nonadecanoic acid. It is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride, an adenosine 5'-phosphate and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It derives from an adenosine 5'-monophosphate and a 19-(4-hydroxyphenyl)nonadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 19-(4-hydroxyphenyl)nonadecanoyl-AMP(1-).
