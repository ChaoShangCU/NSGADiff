The molecule is a pentasaccharide derivative consisting of beta-D-galactose at the reducing end linked glycosidically to a 2-aminoethyl group, while having a beta-D-glucosyl residue at the 4-position and an N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl-(2->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosyl moiety at the 3-position. It is a glycoside and a pentasaccharide derivative. It derives from an alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)]-beta-D-Galp.
