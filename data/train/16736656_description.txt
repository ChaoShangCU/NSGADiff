The molecule is a C-glycosyl compound that is 1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthracen-9(10H)-one substituted by a 1-O-acetyl-3-O-senecioyl-alpha-L-lyxopyranosyl moiety at position 10 via a C-glycosidic linkage (the 10R stereoisomer). It is isolated from the leaves of Alvaradoa haitiensis and exhibits cytotoxicity against human oral epidermoid carcinoma. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a C-glycosyl compound, an acetate ester, a member of anthracenes and a polyphenol. It derives from a 3-methylbut-2-enoic acid.
