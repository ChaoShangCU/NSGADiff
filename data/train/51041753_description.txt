The molecule is an azaphilone that is 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-isochromene substituted by a hydroxy and methyl group at position 7, an oxo group at position 8, a prop-1-en-1-yl group at position 3 and a (2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoyl)oxy group at position 6.Isolated from Penicillium commune, it exhibits antibacterial and antineoplastic activities. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antibacterial agent and a Penicillium metabolite. It is an azaphilone, a benzoate ester, a member of resorcinols, a tertiary alcohol, a member of isochromenes and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from an o-orsellinic acid.
