The molecule is a 10-membered lactone obtained from 10-methyl-9,10-dihydro-2H-oxecin-2-one by the epoxidation of the double bond at position 3-4 and cis-dihydroxylation of the double bond at position 7-8. Multiplolide A was first isolated from the fungus Xylaria multiplex BCC 1111. It shows antifungal activity against Candida albicans. It has a role as a metabolite and an antifungal agent.
