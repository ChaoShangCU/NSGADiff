The molecule is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3E,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid. It is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3E,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl-CoA(4-).
