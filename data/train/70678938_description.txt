The molecule is a branched pentasaccharide derivative consisting of an alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine trisaccharide backbone onto which are linked two alpha-alpha-L-fucosyl residues, one (1->2) onto the central galactose residue and the other (1->3) onto the N-acetylglucosamine residue at the reducing end. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
