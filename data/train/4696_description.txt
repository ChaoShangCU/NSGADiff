The molecule is a furopyran and lactone that is (2H-pyran-3(6H)-ylidene)acetic acid which is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 4 and in which the hydroxy group at position 4 has condensed with the carboxy group to give the corresponding bicyclic lactone. A mycotoxin produced by several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium, it has antibiotic properties but has been shown to be carcinogenic and mutagenic. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, a mycotoxin, a carcinogenic agent, a mutagen, a Penicillium metabolite and an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a furopyran, a lactol and a gamma-lactone.
