The molecule is a glycoside consisting of D-glyceric acid having a 6-O-octanoyl-alpha-D-glucosyl-(1->6)-alpha-D-glucosyl residue attached at position 2 via a glycosidic linkage. It is a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid, a disaccharide derivative, a glycoside and an O-acyl carbohydrate. It derives from a D-glyceric acid and an octanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-O-[6-O-octanoyl-alpha-D-glucosyl-(1->6)-alpha-D-glucosyl]-D-glycerate.
