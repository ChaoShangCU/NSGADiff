The molecule is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride that results from the formal condensation of the phosphoryl group of AMP with the carboxyl group of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate and an acyclic mixed acid anhydride. It derives from a 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and an adenosine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-hydroxybenzoyl-AMP(1-).
