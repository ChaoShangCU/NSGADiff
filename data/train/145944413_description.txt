The molecule is a member of the class of anthracenes that is 3,8,9-trihydroxy-3-methyl-3,4-dihydroanthracen-1(2H)-one which is substituted at position 4 by a 1-acetoxyetyl group and in which the acetoxy-bearing carbon has R configuration while the remaining two chiral centres have S configuration. A putative precursor in the biosynthesis of julichrome Q6-6. The corresponding 8-glucuronide has been isolated from a soil-derived strain of Streptomyces sp. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It is a member of anthracenes, a carbotricyclic compound, an acetate ester, a tertiary alcohol, a member of phenols, a cyclic ketone and a polyketide.
