The molecule is a binaphthopyran resulting from the formal oxidative coupling at position 9 of two molecules of 5,6,8-trihydroxy-2-methyl-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-4-one. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a benzochromenone, a member of phenols, a naphtho-gamma-pyrone and a binaphthopyran. It is a conjugate acid of an ustilaginoidin A(2-).
