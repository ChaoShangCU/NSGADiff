The molecule is a member of the class of tetracenomycins that is 8-demethyltetracenomycin C in which the hydroxyl hydrogen at position 8 is replaced by an alpha-L-rhamnosyl residue. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a tetracenomycin, a member of phenols, an enone, an alpha-L-rhamnoside, an enol ether, a monosaccharide derivative, a methyl ester, a cyclic ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a tetracenomycin C.
