The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of a sialyl residue, linked (2->3) to a galactosyl residue that in turn is linked (1->4) to a glucosaminyl residue, which is sulfated at O-6 and is also carrying a fucosyl residue at the 3-position. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an oligosaccharide sulfate.
