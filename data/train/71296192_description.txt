The molecule is a linear amino tetrasaccharide comprising alpha-sialyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl and N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine residues in a (2->6), (1->4) and (1->3) sequence. alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->6)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc in which the anomeric configuration of the GalNAc residue at the reducing end is beta. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and an alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->6)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc.
