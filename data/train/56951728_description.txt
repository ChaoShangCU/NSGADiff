The molecule is a ceramide phosphoinositol compound having a tetracosanoyl group attached to the ceramide nitrogen, hydroxylation at C-4 of the long-chain base, and no additional hydroxylation of the very-long-chain fatty acid. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It derives from a N-tetracosanoylphytosphingosine. It is a conjugate acid of an Ins-1-P-Cer(t18:0/24:0)(1-).
