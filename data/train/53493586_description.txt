The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2,2'-bipyridine substituted at position 6 by a hydroxymethyl group and at positions 3 and 4 by methoxy groups respectively. Isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is an aromatic ether, a member of bipyridines, a monohydroxypyridine and a pyridine alkaloid. It derives from a hydride of a 2,2'-bipyridine.
