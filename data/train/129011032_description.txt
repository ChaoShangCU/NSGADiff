The molecule is a trisaccharide derivative in which a trisaccharide consisting of alpha-D-galactose, beta-D-galactose and beta-D-glucose residues linked sequentially (1->3) and (1->4), with the glucosyl residue at the reducing end being linked glycosidically to the terminal amide nitrogen of 19-maleimido-17-oxo-4,7,10,13-tetraoxa-16-azanonadecan-1-amide. It is a trisaccharide derivative and a member of maleimides.
