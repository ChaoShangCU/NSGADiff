The molecule is an icosanoid that is (5Z,9E,14Z)-icosa-5,9,14-trienoic acid carrying four hydroxy substituents at positions 8, 11, 12 and 20. An intermediary metabolite from the 12(R)-lipoxygenase pathway. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acid, a straight-chain fatty acid, a trienoic fatty acid, an icosanoid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It derives from a (5Z,9E,14Z)-icosa-5,9,14-trienoic acid.
