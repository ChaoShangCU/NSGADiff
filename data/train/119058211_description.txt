The molecule is an N-acylglycine resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of glycine with the carboxy group of (15S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-icosatetraenoic acid. It has a role as a mammalian metabolite. It is a N-acylglycine, a fatty amide and a lipid hydroperoxide. It derives from a 15(S)-HPETE. It is a conjugate acid of a N-[(15S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-icosatetraenoyl]glycinate.
