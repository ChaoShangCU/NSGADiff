The molecule is an S-acyl-4'-phosphopantetheine obtained by formal condensation of the thiol group of D-pantetheine 4'-phosphate with the carboxy group of tetradecanoic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from a tetradecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a S-tetradecanoyl-4'-phosphopantetheine(2-).
