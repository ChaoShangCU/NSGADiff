The molecule is a synthetic phenylalanine derivative derived formally from the mycotoxin ochratoxin A by amide formation between its carboxy group and 6-aminohexanoic acid. It has a role as a hapten. It is a diastereoisomeric mixture, a N-acyl-L-phenylalanine, a member of isochromanes, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an organochlorine compound and a phenylalanine derivative. It derives from an ochratoxin A.
