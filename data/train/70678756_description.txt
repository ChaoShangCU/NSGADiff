The molecule is an epoxide which is a carboxamide obtained by the formal condensation of one of the carboxy groups of oxirane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid with N-{3-[(4-aminobutyl)amino]propyl}-L-tyrosinamide. It is a natural product, isolated from Gliocladium sp. F-2665. TMC-52A acts as an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, particularly cathepsin B (EC 3.4.22.1), cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15), and papain (EC 3.4.22.2); IC50 values are 320 nM, 13 nM, and 44 nM, respectively. The epoxide group has trans configuration but its exact stereochemistry is uncertain: it is either (2R,3R) or (2S,3S). It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, a cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) inhibitor, an EC 3.4.22.2 (papain) inhibitor, a cathepsin B inhibitor and a fungal metabolite. It is an epoxide, a monocarboxylic acid, a member of phenols, a primary amino compound, a secondary amino compound and a dicarboxylic acid monoamide.
