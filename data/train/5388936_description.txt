The molecule is a cyclodepsipeptide that is N-(3-hydroxypicolinoyl)-L-threonyl-D-alpha-aminobutyryl-L-prolyl-N-methyl-L-phenylalanyl-4-oxo-L-pipecoloyl-L-2-phenylglycine in which the carboxy group of the 2-phenylglycine moiety has undergone formal intramolecular condensation with the hydroxy group of the N-(3-hydroxypicolinoyl)-L-threonyl to give the corresponding 19-membered ring lactone. It is one of the two major components of the antibacterial drug virginiamycin, produced by Streptomyces virginiae, S. loidensis, S. mitakaensis, S. pristina-spiralis, S. ostreogriseus, and others. It has a role as an antibacterial drug and a bacterial metabolite. It is a cyclodepsipeptide and a macrolide antibiotic.
