The molecule is an imidazopyridine that is 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-2-amine substituted by a 4,5-dibromo-1H-pyrrol-2-yl group at position 4. It is an alkaloid isolated from a marine sponge Agelas nakamurai and acts as an inhibitor of the matrix metalloproteinases, the key enzymes involved in tumour growth, migration, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. It has a role as a metabolite, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an angiogenesis inhibitor. It is an imidazopyridine, a member of pyrroles, an organobromine compound, an alkaloid and an aromatic amine.
