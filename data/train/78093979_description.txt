The molecule is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (10R)-10-hydroxyundecanoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It is a monocarboxylic acid and an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from a (10R)-10-hydroxyundecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an ascr#18(1-).
