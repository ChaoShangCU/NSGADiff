The molecule is a hydroxyretinoic glucuronide that is all-trans-4-hydroxyretinoic acid attached to a beta-D-glucuronic acid residue via a glycosidic linkage. It is a hydroxyretinoic glucuronide and a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid. It derives from an all-trans-4-hydroxyretinoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-(beta-D-glucopyranuronosyloxy)retinoate(2-).
