The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 3'-O-methyltricetin substituted by an alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 3. It has a role as a metabolite. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative, a trihydroxyflavone and a member of 3'-methoxyflavones. It derives from an alpha-L-rhamnopyranose and a 3'-O-methyltricetin.
