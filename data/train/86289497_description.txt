The molecule is a phosphatidylethanolamine 40:6 zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the phosphate to the primary amino group of 1-octadecanoyl-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. It is a tautomer of a 1-octadecanoyl-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
