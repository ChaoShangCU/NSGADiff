The molecule is a member of the cadinene family of sesquiterpenes in which the double bonds are located at the 4-4a and 7-8 positions, and in which the isopropyl group at position 1 is cis to the hydrogen at the adjacent bridgehead carbon (the 1R,8aS-enantiomer). It is a cadinene and a delta-cadinene. It is an enantiomer of a (+)-delta-cadinene.
