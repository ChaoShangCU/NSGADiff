The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide consisting of a linear tetrasaccharide of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, beta-D-galactose and beta-D-glucose residues linked sequentially (1->3), (1->4) and (1->4), to the galactose residue proximal to the reducing end is also linked (2->3) an N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl-(2->8)-N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl-(2->8)-N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl trisaccharide side-chain. The carbohydrate moiety of ganglioside GT1c. It is an amino heptasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
