The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside resulting from the formal condensation of 1-hydroxy group of beta-D-glucopyranose with the carboxy group of indole-3-butyric acid. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, an indolyl carbohydrate and an indolyl carboxylate ester. It derives from an indole-3-butyric acid.
