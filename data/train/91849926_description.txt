The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residues joine in sequence by (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc and a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-Galp.
