The molecule is a six-membered homodetic cyclic peptide composed from L-phenylglycyl, D-tryptophyl, L-lysyl, O-benzyl-L-tyrosyl, L-phenylalanyl and modified L-hydroxyproline residues joined in sequence. A somatostatin analogue with pharmacologic properties mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin; used (as its diaspartate salt) for treatment of Cushing's disease. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide and a peptide hormone. It is a conjugate base of a pasireotide(2+).
