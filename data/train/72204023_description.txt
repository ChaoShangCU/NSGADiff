The molecule is a dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid that is (4Z,8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid in which the two hydroxy substituents are located at the 7S- and 14S-positions. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a specialised pro-resolving mediator. It is a dihydroxydocosahexaenoic acid and a secondary allylic alcohol. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7S,14S)-dihydroxy-(4Z,8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoate.
