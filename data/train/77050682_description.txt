The molecule is a chloropyridine that is 3-chloropyridine substituted by a 1-oxo-2,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl group and a 4-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)phenyl group at positions 4 and 5, respectively. It is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of Wnt signaling (IC50 = 5 nM) and a potent and selective chemical probe for cyclin-dependent kinases CDK8 and CDK19. It has a role as a Wnt signalling inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor. It is a chloropyridine, a member of pyrazoles and an azaspiro compound.
