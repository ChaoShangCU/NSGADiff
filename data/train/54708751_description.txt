The molecule is a pyranone that is 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one in which two of the hydrogens of the methyl group are replaced by a cycloprop-2-en-1-yl group and a 3-{[N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-beta-alanyl]amino}phenyl group (S-configuration) and in which the hydrogen at position 6 is replaced by a 1-phenylbutan-2-yl group (R-configuration). It has a role as a HIV protease inhibitor. It is a member of cyclopropenes, a carbamate ester, an anilide, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a member of 2-pyranones.
