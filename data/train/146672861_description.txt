The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide consisting of a D-glucosyl residue beta-linked to a 3-aminopropyl group and which carries an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl unit linked (1->6) and an N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl-(2->3)-beta-D-galactosyl unit linked (1->4). Its conjugation to the carrier protein CRM197 elicits an immune response to type III Group B Streptococcus (GBSIII) indicating that it may suffice as a synthetic vaccine antigen. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glycoside. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->6)-[alpha-Neup5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
