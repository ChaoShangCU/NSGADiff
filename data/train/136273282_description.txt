The molecule is a double-stranded DNA polynucleotide comprising in one strand a repeating sequence of one thymidine residue and and two deoxycytidine residues, with in a complementary strand a repeating sequence of two deoxyguanosine residues and one deoxyadenosine residue, all residues in each strand being connected by 3'->5' phosphodiester linkages. It contains a poly[d(TCC)] and a poly[d(GGA)].
