The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of a beta-D-galactopyranose residue and two 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and a N-acetyllactosamine.
