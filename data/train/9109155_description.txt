The molecule is an N-(1-benzylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-5,6-dimethylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine in which the chiral centre has R configuration. Both enantiomers act as fatty acid synthase inhibitors, although the (S)-enantiomer was found to be more than 4 times as active as the (R)-enantiomer. It has a role as a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor and an EC 2.3.1.85 (fatty acid synthase) inhibitor. It is an enantiomer of a (S)-Fasnall.
