The molecule is a triterpene glycoside that consists of 25-O-methoxycimigenol attached to a alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the rhizomes of Cimicifuga racemosa, it exhibits cytotoxic activities. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a bridged compound, a cyclic ether, an alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a cimigenol. It derives from a hydride of a cycloartane.
