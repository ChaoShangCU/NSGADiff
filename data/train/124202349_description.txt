The molecule is a leukotriene that is (5S,7E,9E,12R,14Z)-5,12-dihydroxyicosa-7,9,14-trienoic acid to which a glutathionyl group is attached at position 6 via a sulfide linkage. It is a glutathione derivative, a leukotriene, an organic sulfide, a tricarboxylic acid and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a leukotriene C4. It is a conjugate acid of an 11,12-dihydro-(12R)-hydroxyleukotriene C4(2-).
