The molecule is a member of the class of 2-benzofurans that is 6,7-dihydro-2-benzofuran-4(5H)-one that is substituted at positions 5 and 6 by hydroxy groups, at position 5 by a methyl group and at position 1 by a (2E,4E,6S)-4,6-dimethylocta-2,4-dienoyl group (the 5S,6R-diastereoisomer). A polyketide that was first obtained from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans by using a genomic mining approach. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a fungal metabolite. It is a member of 2-benzofurans, a tertiary alcohol, a secondary alcohol, a cyclic ketone, a diol, a polyketide and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
