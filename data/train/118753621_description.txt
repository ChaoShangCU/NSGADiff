The molecule is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A in which residues 6 and 9 (both N-methylleucine) have undergone oxidation so a to introduce a hydroxy group at position 4 (the carbon bearing the two methyl groups) in each case. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M1.
