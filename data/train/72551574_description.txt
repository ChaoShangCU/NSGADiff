The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion that is the conjugate base of 19-HEPE, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a hydroxy fatty acid anion, a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion, a long-chain fatty acid anion, an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid anion and a HEPE(1-). It derives from an all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoate. It is a conjugate base of a 19-HEPE.
