The molecule is an oligosaccharide sulfate consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-sulfo-beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2,4-dideoxy-beta-D-xylo-hexopyranose joined in sequence by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. It is an oligosaccharide sulfate and an amino disaccharide. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine 4-sulfate and a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine.
