The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose, alpha-D-glucopyranose and D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->6) and (1->2) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-D-Glcp-(1->2)-D-Glcp.
