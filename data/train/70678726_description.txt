The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucose, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine and alpha-D-galactose residues joined in sequence with (1->2)-, (1->3)- and (1->3)-linkages, respectively. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->3)-alpha-D-Galp.
