The molecule is an azaphilone that is 7,8-dihydro-6H-oxireno[j]isochromene substituted by a hepta-1,3,5-trien-1-yl group at position 3, a [3-hydroxybutanoyl]oxy group at position 7, a methyl group at position 7 and oxo groups at positions 6 and 8 respectively (the 3S,7S stereoisomer). A fungal metabolite, it is isolated from the fermentation broth of Penicillium solitum strain CT2108 and exhibits inhibitory activity against fatty acid synthase as well as fungicidal activity. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an antifungal agent, an EC 2.3.1.85 (fatty acid synthase) inhibitor and a Penicillium metabolite. It is an azaphilone, an epoxide, a carboxylic ester, a secondary alcohol, an enone and an organic heterotricyclic compound.
