The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoester that is ethyl 4-phenylbutanoate in which a hydrogen alpha to the carboxy group is substituted by the amino group of L-alanyl-L-proline (S-configuration). It has a role as a prodrug, an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and an antihypertensive agent. It is a dicarboxylic acid monoester and a dipeptide.
