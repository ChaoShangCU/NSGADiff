The molecule is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the (omega-1)-hydroxy group of (3R,21R)-3,21-dihydroxydocosanoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside, a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a (3R,21R)-3,21-dihydroxybehenic acid.
