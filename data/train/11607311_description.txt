The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that consists of kaempferol attached to a 2,3-di-E-p-coumaroyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl moiety at position 7. Isolated from the flowers and fruits of Tetrapanax papyriferus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cinnamate ester, a monosaccharide derivative and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid.
