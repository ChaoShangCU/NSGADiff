The molecule is a glycophytoceramide having a 4-O-(4-chlorobenzyl)-alpha-D-galactosyl residue at the O-1 position and a hexacosanoyl group attached to the nitrogen. One of a series of an extensive set of 4"-O-alkylated alpha-GalCer analogues evaluated (PMID:30556652) as invariant natural killer T-cell (iNKT) antigens. It derives from an alpha-D-galactose.
