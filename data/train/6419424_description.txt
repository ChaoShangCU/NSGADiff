The molecule is a nocardicin in which the beta-lactam moiety is substituted at position 1 by a carboxy(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl group and at position 3 by a [(2Z)-2-(hydroxyimino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]nitrilo group in which the phenolic hydroxy group is substituted by a (3S)-3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group. It is a dicarboxylic acid, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid, a member of phenols, an aromatic ether and a nocardicin. It derives from a L-homoserine and a D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine. It is a tautomer of an isonocardicin A zwitterion.
