The molecule is a tertiary carboxamide that is piperazine in which one of the amino groups has undergone condensation with the carboxy group of N-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)sulfonyl]-L-serine, while the other has undergone condensation with the carboxy group of N-(1-benzothiophen-2-ylcarbonyl)-L-leucine. It is a cell-permeable, potent and selective agonist of the TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) channel. It has a role as a TRPV4 agonist. It is a member of 1-benzothiophenes, a N-acylpiperazine, a sulfonamide, a dichlorobenzene, a tertiary carboxamide and an aromatic primary alcohol.
