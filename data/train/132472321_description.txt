The molecule is a docosanoid that is (7R,17S)-dihydroxy-(4Z,9,11,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid in which a cysteinylglycinyl group is attached at position 8S via a sulfide linkage. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a specialised pro-resolving mediator and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a dicarboxylic acid, a dipeptide, a docosanoid, an organic sulfide and a secondary allylic alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of an (8S)-glycinylcystein-S-yl-(7R,17S)-dihydroxy-(4Z,9,11,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoate(1-).
