The molecule is a microcystin consisting of D-alanyl, L-leucyl, (3S)-3-methyl-D-beta-aspartyl,L-arginyl, 2S,3S,4E,6E,8S,9S)-3-amino-4,5,6,7-tetradehydro-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldecanoyl, D-gamma-glutamyl, and 2,3-didehydro-N-methylalanyl residues joined into a 25-membered macrocycle. Produced by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, it is the most studied of the microcystins. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an EC 3.1.3.16 (phosphoprotein phosphatase) inhibitor, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant.
