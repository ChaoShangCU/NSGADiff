The molecule is a linear tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of a 6-O-[(2-aminoethoxy)(hydroxy)phosphoryl-alpha-D-mannose residue, two alpha-D-mannose residues and one beta-D-glucosamine residue, linked sequentially (1->2), (1->6) and (1->4), with the glucosamine residue linked glycosidically to a 6-sulfanylhexyl group. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
