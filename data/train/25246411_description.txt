The molecule is an S-conjugate in which the mercapto hydrogen of L-cysteinylglycine has been replaced by an N-hydroxy-2-phenylethanimidoyl group. It is a N-hydroxyimidothioate, a S-conjugate and a dipeptide. It derives from a L-cysteinylglycine. It is a tautomer of a S-[(Z)-N-hydroxy-2-phenylethanimidoyl]-L-cysteinylglycine zwitterion.
