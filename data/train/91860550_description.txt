The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of beta-D-galactopyranosyl. 2-acetamido-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl and 2-acetamido-D-glucopyranosyl residues joined in sequence by (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-alpha-D-GalNAc.
