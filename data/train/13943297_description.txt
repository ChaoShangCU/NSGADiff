The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is cycloastragenol having beta-D-xylopyranosyl and beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues attached at positions O-3 and O-6 respectively. It is isolated from Astragalus membranaceus var mongholicus. It has a role as an EC 4.2.1.1 (carbonic anhydrase) inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent, a neuroprotective agent, an antioxidant, a pro-angiogenic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a cycloastragenol.
