The molecule is a dihydropyridine that is that is 1,4-dihydropyridine which is substituted at positions 2 and 6 by methyl groups, at positions 3 and 5 by ethoxycarbonyl groups, and at position 4 by a pentafluorophenyl group. An L-type calcium channel alpha1-subunit antagonist. When exposed to the microscopic soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, nemadipine-A induces a variety of defects including those affecting morphology and egg laying. It has a role as a calcium channel blocker. It is a dihydropyridine, a diester, a member of pentafluorobenzenes, an ethyl ester and a member of dicarboxylic acids and O-substituted derivatives.
