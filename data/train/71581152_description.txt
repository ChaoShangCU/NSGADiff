The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z)-3-oxooctacosatetraenoyl-CoA. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and an ultra-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z)-3-oxooctacosatetraenoyl-CoA.
