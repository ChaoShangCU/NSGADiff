The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-oxodocosatrienoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-oxodocosatrienoyl-CoA(4-).
