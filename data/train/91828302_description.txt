The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3S,7Z)-3-hydroxyhexadecenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain (3S)-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3S,7Z)-3-hydroxyhexadecenoyl-CoA(4-).
