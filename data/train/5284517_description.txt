The molecule is an amino cyclitol glycoside that is L-chiro-inositol in which the hydroxy groups at positions 1, 4, and 6 are replaced by aminoacetyl)methylamino, amino, and methoxy groups, respectively, and in which the hydroxy group at position 3 is converted to the corresponding 2,6-diamino-2,3,4,6,7-pentadeoxy-beta-L-lyxo-heptopyranoside. The major component of fortimicin, obtained from Micromonospora olivasterospora. It is administered (as the sulfate salt) by intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion for the treatment of severe systemic infections due to sensitive Gram-negative organisms. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and a metabolite. It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, an amino cyclitol glycoside, a primary amino compound, a diol and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
