The molecule is a butenolide that is furan-2(5H)-one substituted by a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a methyl group at position 4. Isolated from an edible mushroom Mycoleptodonoides aitchisonii, it exhibits protective activity against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress dependent cell death. It has a role as a metabolite and a neuroprotective agent. It is a butenolide and a primary alcohol.
