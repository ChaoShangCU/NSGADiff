The molecule is an aromatic amide obtained by formal condensation of the amino group of 2-(6-methoxy-1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-1,3-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of 4-(piperazin-1-yl)pyridin-3-amine. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.1 (non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor, an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an aromatic amide, an aminopyridine, a N-arylpiperazine, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an aromatic ether, a gamma-lactam and a member of isoindoles.
