The molecule is a cardenolide glycoside that is sarmentologenin glycosylated at position 3 by a beta-allosyl-(1->4)-beta-6-deoxyallosyl moiety. Isolated from Elaeodendron alluaudianum, it exhibits antiproliferative activity against human ovarian cancer and human histiocytic lymphoma cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a steroid lactone, a cardenolide glycoside and a hydroxy steroid. It derives from a sarmentologenin.
