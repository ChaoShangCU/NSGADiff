The molecule is trianion of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine(3-) arising from deprotonation of diphosphate and carboxy groups and protonation of the side-chain amino group of the lysyl residue; major species at pH 7.3. It is a nucleotide-sugar oxoanion and a peptide anion. It is a conjugate base of an UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine.
