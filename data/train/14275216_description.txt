The molecule is a monounsaturated fatty acid that is nonadecanoic acid that has been dehydrogenated to introduce a double bond with Z configuration between the carbons at positions 9 and 10. It has been isolated from the spores of reishi mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum, and found to inhibit tumour cell proliferation and induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells. It has a role as a fungal metabolite, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a long-chain fatty acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid and a straight-chain fatty acid.
