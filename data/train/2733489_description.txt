The molecule is a fumonisin that is (2S,3S,12S,14S,15R,16R)-2-amino-12,16-dimethylicosane-3,14,15-triol in which the hydroxy groups at positions 14 and 15 have each been esterified by condensation with the 1-carboxy group of 3-carboxyglutaric acid (giving a 3-carboxyglutarate ester group with R configuration in each case). It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite and a carcinogenic agent. It is a fumonisin, a primary amino compound, a diol and a diester.
