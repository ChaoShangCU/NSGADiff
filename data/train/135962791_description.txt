The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2-phenylpyridine substituted by a methoxy group at position 4 and a (E)-(hydroxyimino)methyl group at position 6. Isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is an aldoxime, an aromatic ether and a pyridine alkaloid.
