The molecule is a leukotriene composed of (6Z,8E,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoic acid having (5S)- and (12R)-hydroxy substituents. It has a role as a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a leukotriene, a long-chain fatty acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It derives from an icosa-6,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a leukotriene B4(1-).
