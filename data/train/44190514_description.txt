The molecule is an L-serine derivative resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of oleic acid with the amino group of L-serine. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent and a mouse metabolite. It is a L-serine derivative and a N-(fatty acyl)-L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from an oleic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-oleoyl-L-serinate.
