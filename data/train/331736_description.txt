The molecule is a cyclic ketone that is (-)-phyllostine in which the carbonyl group which is furthest from the hydroxymethyl substituent has been formally reduced to give the corresponding secondary alcohol with S configuration. A metabolite of the patulin pathway in Penicillium urticae. It has a role as a Penicillium metabolite. It is an epoxide, a primary allylic alcohol, a secondary allylic alcohol, an enone and a cyclic ketone.
