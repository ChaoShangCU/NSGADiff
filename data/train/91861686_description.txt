The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide in which an alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucose linear pentasaccharide carries at the galactose residue proximal to the reducing end a second alpha-L-fucosyl residue via a (1->2) linkage. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a N-[(2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-4-[(2R,3R,4S,5R,6R)-4,5-Dihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)-3-[(2S,3S,4R,5S,6S)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxyoxan-2-yl]oxy-5-hydroxy-2-[(2R,3S,4S,5R,6S)-3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-3-yl]oxy-5-[(2S,3S,4R,5S,6S)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxyoxan-4-yl]oxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-3-yl]acetamide.
