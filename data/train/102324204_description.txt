The molecule is an Aspidosperma alkaloid with formula C21H24N2O4 found in Catharantheus lanceus. Note that the stereoconfiguration of the epoxy group is based on CHEBI:144374, and of the 19 hydroxy group on CHEBI:144372 (the same enzyme produces the two). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an Aspidosperma alkaloid, an organic heterohexacyclic compound, a tertiary amino compound, an epoxide, a methyl ester, a secondary amino compound and a secondary alcohol. It is a conjugate base of a hoerhammericine(1+).
