The molecule is a diterpenoid that is 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,8a-octahydronaphthalene substituted by methyl groups at positions 4a and 8 and a 6-methylhepta-1,5-dien-2-yl group at position 2 (the 2S,4aR,8aR-stereoisomer). It has been isolated from from the Hainan soft coral Lobophytum cristatum. It has a role as a coral metabolite. It is a diterpenoid, a carbobicyclic compound and a member of octahydronaphthalenes.
