The molecule is a double-stranded DNA polynucleotide consisting of in one strand a repeating unit of thymidine and 5-methyldeoxycytosine residues, with in a complementary strand a repeating unit of deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine residues, all residues in each strand being connected by 3'->5' phosphodiester linkages. It contains a poly[d(Tm(5)C)] and a poly[d(GA)].
