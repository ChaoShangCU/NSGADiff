The molecule is a 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 3,5-bisphosphate(5-) arising from deprotonation of all five free phosphate OH groups of 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1D-myo-inositol-3,5-bisphosphate); major species at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate base of a 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1D-myo-inositol-3,5-bisphosphate).
