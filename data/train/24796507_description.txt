The molecule is an organosulfate oxoanion that is the conjugate base of (4R)-4,8-dimethylnonyl hydrogen sulfate. It has been isolated from Daphnia pulex and has been found to induce morphological changes in the phytoplankton, Scenedesmus gutwinskii. It has a role as a Daphnia pulex metabolite and a kairomone. It is a conjugate base of a (4R)-4,8-dimethylnonyl hydrogen sulfate.
