The molecule is a trans,trans-2,3,4,5-tetradehydroacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans,trans-2,4-hexadienoic acid. It is a trans,trans-2,3,4,5-tetradehydroacyl-CoA and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a trans,trans-2,4-hexadienoyl-CoA(4-).
