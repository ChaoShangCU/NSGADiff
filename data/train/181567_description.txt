The molecule is a pyrrolopyrazine that is hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione bearing an indol-3-ylmethyl substituent at position 3 (the 3S,8aS-diastereomer, obtained by formal cyclocondensation of L-tryptophan and L-proline). It has a role as a metabolite. It is a pyrrolopyrazine, a member of indoles and a dipeptide.
