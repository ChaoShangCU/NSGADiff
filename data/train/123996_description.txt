The molecule is the amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxylic acid group of F420-0 with the amino group of L-gamma-glutamyl-L-glutamic acid. It has a role as a coenzyme. It is a member of pyrimidoquinolines and a ribitol phosphate. It derives from a 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin. It is a conjugate acid of a coenzyme gamma-F420-2(5-) and a coenzyme gamma-F420-2(4-).
