The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid that is 2-chloro-4-fluorophenylacetic acid in which the phenyl group is substituted at position 5 by a 4-chloro-5-(difluoromethoxy)-1-methylpyrazol-3-yl group. A protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor, it is used (usually as the corresponding ethyl ester proherbicide, pyraflufen-ethyl) for the control of broad-leaved weeds and grasses in a variety of crops. It has a role as an EC 1.3.3.4 (protoporphyrinogen oxidase) inhibitor, a herbicide and an agrochemical. It is a member of monofluorobenzenes, a member of pyrazoles, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a biaryl, an aromatic ether and a monocarboxylic acid.
