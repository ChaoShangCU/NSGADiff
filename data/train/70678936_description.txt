The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising a linear sequence of alpha-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactosamine and beta-D-glucosamine residues linked (1->3), (1->4) and (1->4), with an N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminic acid residue linked (2->6) to the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
