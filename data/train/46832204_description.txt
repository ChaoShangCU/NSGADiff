The molecule is a carboxylic ester resulting from the formal condensation of caffeic acid with the hydroxy group at position 6 of the terminal glucose residue of quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside. It is a tetrahydroxyflavone and a carboxylic ester. It derives from a quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside and a trans-caffeic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a quercetin 3-O-[(6-O-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside](2-).
