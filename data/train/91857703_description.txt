The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprising a linear pentasaccharide chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (1->4), (1->3), (1->4), (1->6), to the N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine residue at the reducing end of which is also linked (1->3) a further beta-D-galactose residue. It is an amino hexasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
