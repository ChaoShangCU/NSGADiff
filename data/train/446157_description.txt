The molecule is a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is (6E)-7-{4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]-6-(propan-2-yl)pyrimidin-5-yl} hept-6-enoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 3 and 5 (the 3R,5S-diastereomer). It has a role as an antilipemic drug, an anti-inflammatory agent, a CETP inhibitor, a cardioprotective agent, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of pyrimidines, a sulfonamide, a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a statin (synthetic) and a member of monofluorobenzenes. It derives from a hept-6-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a rosuvastatin(1-).
