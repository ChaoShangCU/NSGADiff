The molecule is an amino acid betaine that is L-proline zwitterion in which both of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen are replaced by methyl groups. It has a role as a food component, a plant metabolite and a human blood serum metabolite. It is a N-methyl-L-alpha-amino acid, an alkaloid and an amino-acid betaine. It derives from a L-prolinium. It is a conjugate base of a N,N-dimethyl-L-prolinium. It is an enantiomer of a D-proline betaine.
