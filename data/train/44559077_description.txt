The molecule is an extended flavonoid that consists of (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5 and 4', a methoxy group at position 3' , a prenyl group at position 6 and a gem-dimethylpyran ring fused across positions 7 and 8. Isolated from Lonchocarpus utilis and Lonchocarpus urucu, it acts as a NADH:ubiquinone reductase inhibitor. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.6.5.3 [NADH:ubiquinone reductase (H(+)-translocating)] inhibitor. It is a dihydroxyflavanone, an extended flavonoid, a monomethoxyflavanone, a pyranochromane, a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones and a member of 3'-methoxyflavanones.
