The molecule is one of three isomeric monoterpenes differing in the positions of their two double bonds (alpha- and beta-terpinene being the others). In gamma-terpinene the double bonds are at the 1- and 4-positions of the p-menthane skeleton. It has a role as an antioxidant, a plant metabolite, a volatile oil component and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a monoterpene and a cyclohexadiene.
