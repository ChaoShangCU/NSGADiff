The molecule is a branched hexasaccharide comprising six D-arabinofuranose units, in an assembly consisting of two arabinose residues linked alpha(1->5) (with alpha-configuration at the reducing end), with alpha-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl disaccharide units linked to the 3- and 5-positions of the residue distal from the reducing-end residue. Branched hexasaccharide from the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It has a role as an epitope.
