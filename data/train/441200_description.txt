The molecule is a member of the class of cyclohexenones that is cyclohex-2-en-1-one substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2, 4, 5 and 6 (the 4R,5S,6R-stereoisomer). It is a member of cyclohexenones, an enone and an enol. It derives from a cyclohex-2-enone. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R,4S,5R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-oxocyclohex-1-en-1-olate. It is a tautomer of a 3D-3,5/4-trihydroxycyclohexane-1,2-dione.
