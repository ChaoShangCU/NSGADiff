The molecule is a 1-(alk-1-enyl)-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine in which the alk-1-enyl and acyl groups are specified as (1Z)-octadecenyl and (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl respectively. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a tautomer of a 1-(1Z-octadecenyl)-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion.
