The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is dammarenediol-II where the hydrogen of the hydroxy group at position 20 is replaced by a beta-D-glucoside. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a monosaccharide derivative and a 3beta-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylsteroid. It derives from a dammarenediol-II. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
