The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2, 3 and 23 respectively (the 2alpha,3beta-stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the leaves of Rosa laevigata. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a triol and a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid.
