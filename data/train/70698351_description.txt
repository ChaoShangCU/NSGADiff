The molecule is a trisaccharide derivative that is cyanidin substituted at position 3 by a 6-O-[6-O-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl]-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactosyl moiety. It is a trisaccharide derivative and a xylosylgalactoside. It derives from a cyanidin cation and a trans-4-coumaric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a cyanidin 3-O-{6-O-[6-O-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl]-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside}(1-).
