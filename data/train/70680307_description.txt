The molecule is a glycopeptidolipid consisting of L-lysine, to the N-2 of which is attached an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetylmuramoyl moiety connected to the amino terminus of the dipeptide L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, and to the N-6 of which is attached a stearoyl group. It has a role as an epitope. It is a N-acetyl-beta-D-glycosaminyl glycopeptide, a glycopeptidolipid and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
