The molecule is a steroid saponin that is 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol attached to a alpha-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a Daphnia magna metabolite. It is a steroid saponin, an androstanoid, a 17beta-hydroxy steroid, an alpha-D-glucoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol.
