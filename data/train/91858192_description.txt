The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3 have each been converted into the corresponding 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl derivative. It is an oligosaccharide, an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-D-Galp.
