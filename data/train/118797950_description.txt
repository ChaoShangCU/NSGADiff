The molecule is a ceramide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of hexacosanoic acid with the amino group of 14-methylhexadecasphingosine. It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a ceramide, a Cer(d43:1) and a N-(very-long-chain fatty acyl)-sphingoid base. It derives from a 14-methylhexadecasphingosine and a hexacosanoic acid.
