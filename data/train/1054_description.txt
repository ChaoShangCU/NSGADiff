The molecule is a hydroxymethylpyridine with hydroxymethyl groups at positions 4 and 5, a hydroxy group at position 3 and a methyl group at position 2. The 4-methanol form of vitamin B6, it is converted intoto pyridoxal phosphate which is a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters, sphingolipids and aminolevulinic acid. It has a role as a cofactor, a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a monohydroxypyridine, a vitamin B6, a member of methylpyridines and a hydroxymethylpyridine.
