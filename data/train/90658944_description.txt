The molecule is a zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the phosphate to the amino group of a glycerophosphoethanolamine. Positions 1 and 2 of sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine are substituted by geranylgeranyl groups. It is a tautomer of a 2,3-bis-O-(geranylgeranyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
