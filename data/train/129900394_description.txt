The molecule is an abietane diterpenoid found in the medicinal plant Isodon rubescens that is 7alpha,8beta-dihydroxyabiet-13-ene in which the 20-methyl group has undergone formal oxidation to the corresponding carboxy group and condensed with the 8-hydroxy group to give the corresponding gamma-lactone. It has shown inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of the dental bacterium Streptococcus mutans. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and a plant metabolite. It is a tetracyclic diterpenoid, a gamma-lactone, a secondary alcohol, an olefinic compound and an abietane diterpenoid.
