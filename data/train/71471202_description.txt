The molecule is an oligosaccharide sulfate formed by sulfating propyl N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-2-O-acetyl-alpha-D-glucoside at O-6 of the reducing-end residue. It is an amino disaccharide, an oligosaccharide sulfate and a glycoside. It is a conjugate acid of a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-alpha-D-Glcp2Ac6SOPr(1-).
