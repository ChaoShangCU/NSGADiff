The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-sulfo-alpha-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by a (1->6) glycosidic bond. It is an amino disaccharide, an oligosaccharide sulfate, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-alpha-D-GalpNAc.
