The molecule is a chondramide formally obtained from N-[(2S,4E,6R,7R)-7-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyloct-4-enoyl]-L-alanyl-Nalpha-methyl-D-tryptophanyl-beta-R-beta-tyrosine by intramolecular condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group with the carboxy group of the beta-tyrosine residue. It is produced by strains of the myxobacterium, Chondromyces crocatus. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a chondramide, a member of indoles and a member of phenols.
