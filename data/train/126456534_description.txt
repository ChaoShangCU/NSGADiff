The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 12-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoic acid. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-12-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 12-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
