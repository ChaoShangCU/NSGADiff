The molecule is a docosanoid that is (7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 14S and 21. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a docosanoid, a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid, a long-chain fatty acid and a secondary allylic alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of a 14(S),21-dihydroxy-(7Z,10Z,12E,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoate.
