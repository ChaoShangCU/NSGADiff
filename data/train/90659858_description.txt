The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of two repeating units of beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc joined by a (1->3)-linkage with an alpha-L-fucosyl residue attached at the 2-position of the galactose residue at the non-reducing end. It is an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-GlcpNAc, an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
