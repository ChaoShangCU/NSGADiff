The molecule is a disaccharide derivative that is isovitexin attached to a 4-O-[(2E)-3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-enoyl]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 2 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a trihydroxyflavone, a C-glycosyl compound, a cinnamate ester and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from an isovitexin and a trans-sinapic acid.
