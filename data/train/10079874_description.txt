The molecule is a 38-membered ring lactone containing seven (E)-double bonds between positions 22 and 35 and substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 9, 11, 13, 17 and 19, oxo groups at positions 3, 7 and 15, a carboxy group at position 18, a 3-amino-3,6-dideoxymannopyranosyloxy group at position 21, a methyl group at position 36 and a 7-(4-aminophenyl)-5-hydroxy-4-methyl-7-oxoheptan-2-yl group at position 37. It is the major component of candicidin, a mixture of antifungal heptaene macrolides obtained from a strain of Streptomyces griseus. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite and an antifungal drug. It is a macrolide antibiotic and a polyene antibiotic.
