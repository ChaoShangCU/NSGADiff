The molecule is an aminoglycoside that is 4alpha,6alpha-diaminocyclohexane-1beta,2alpha,3beta-triol in which the pro-R hydroxy group has been converted into its 2-acetamido-alpha-D-glucoside derivative. It derives from an alpha-D-glucose and a 2-deoxystreptamine. It is a conjugate base of a 2'-N-acetylparomamine(2+).
