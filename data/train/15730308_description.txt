The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of a molecule of dihydrocaffeic acid with each of the primary amino groups of spermidine. Found in potato tubers. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a secondary carboxamide, a member of catechols and a secondary amino compound. It derives from a 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and a spermidine.
