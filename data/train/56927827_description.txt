The molecule is a tetrahydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide obtained by formal stero- and regioselective hydration across the 2,3-double bond in the nicotinyl ring of NADPH, with the hydroxy group located at position 2, having (R)-configuration. It is a tetrahydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and a hemiaminal. It derives from a NADPH. It is a conjugate acid of a (R)-NADPHX(4-).
