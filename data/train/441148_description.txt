The molecule is a pseudodisaccharide, 1D-myo-inosityl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, in which the hydroxy group at the 2-position of the glucose moiety is replaced by an (N-acetyl-L-cysteinyl)amido group. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, a reducing agent and a cofactor. It is a 2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucoside, a thiol and a member of mycothiols. It derives from a myo-inositol.
