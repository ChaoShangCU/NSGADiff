The molecule is a pyrrolotriazine that is pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine which is substituted at position 2 by the pyrrolidine nitrogen of (2S)-N-(6-fluoropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylprolinamide, and at position 4 by a (5-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino group. It is a potent, reversible inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor family kinases. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pyrrolotriazine, a member of pyrazoles, a member of pyridines and a member of pyrrolidines.
