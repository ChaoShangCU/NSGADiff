The molecule is an organic heterohexacyclic compound isolated from a mussel-derived Aspergillus species that is 3,6b,7,7a,10,11,12,12a,14a,15-decahydro-8H,13H-pyrano[2,3-g]pyrrolo[1'',2'':4',5']pyrazino[1',2':1,5]pyrrolo[2,3-b]indole-8,13-dione which is substituted by two methyl groups at position 3, a hydroxy group at the 6b position, and a 2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl group at the 14a position (the 6bR, 7aS, 12aS, 14aS stereoisomer). It has a role as a mycotoxin. It is a dipeptide, an organic heterohexacyclic compound, a notoamide and an aminal.
