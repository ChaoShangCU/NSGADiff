The molecule is a steroid acid that is 9beta,19-cyclo-5alpha-ergost-24(28)-ene-4alpha-carboxylic acid which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 8alpha, and 11alpha positions, by a methyl group at the 4beta position, and by oxo groups at positions 1 and 6. It is a cholesterol and ergosterol synthesis inhibitor isolated from the fungus Sporormiella minima that specifically targets the enzyme, sterol-4-alpha-carboxylate-3-dehydrogenase, encoded by ERG26 in budding yeast, and NSDHL in humans. It has a role as an EC 1.1.1.170 [3beta-hydroxysteroid-4alpha-carboxylate 3-dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)] inhibitor, a fungal metabolite, an antifungal agent and an ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a 6-oxo steroid, an 11alpha-hydroxy steroid, a member of cyclopropanes, a steroid acid and an 8-hydroxy steroid.
