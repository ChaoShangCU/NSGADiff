The molecule is a synthetic glucocorticoid drug that is particularly effective as an immunosuppressant, and affects virtually all of the immune system. Prednisone is a prodrug that is converted by the liver into prednisolone (a beta-hydroxy group instead of the oxo group at position 11), which is the active drug and also a steroid. It has a role as a prodrug, an anti-inflammatory drug, an antineoplastic agent, an immunosuppressive agent and an adrenergic agent. It is a 20-oxo steroid, an 11-oxo steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a glucocorticoid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid, a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
