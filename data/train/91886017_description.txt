The molecule is a beta-D-galactoside that is the 4-methoxyphenyl glycoside of a disaccharide consisting of a beta-D-glucuronic acid residue linked (1->3) to beta-D-galactose. It is a beta-D-galactoside and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpA-(1->3)-beta-D-Galp. It is a conjugate acid of a beta-D-GlcA-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-OC6H4-4-OMe(1-).
