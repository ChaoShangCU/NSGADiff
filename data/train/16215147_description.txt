The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (2S)-5,7,3',5'-tetrahydroxyflavanone attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Jasminum lanceolarium, it exhibits radical scavenging activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is a trihydroxyflavanone, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucoside.
