The molecule is a glycosyl alditol derivative consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactitol residues joined in sequence by (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is a glycosyl alditol derivative, a member of acetamides and a partially-defined glycan. It derives from a N-acetyl-D-galactosaminitol.
