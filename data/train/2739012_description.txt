The molecule is a dicarboximide that consists of semicarbazide in which the formyl hydrogen is substituted by a 3,5-bis(methylthio)1,2-thiazol-4-yl group and one of the hydrogens from the NH2 function is substituted by a 3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl group. It is an organochlorine compound, an organofluorine compound, a member of 1,2-thiazoles, a dicarboximide and a methyl sulfide. It derives from a semicarbazide.
