The molecule is a kaempferol O-glucoside that is the 2''-acetyl derivative of astragalin (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside). Isolated from the aerial parts of Delphinium staphisagria, it exhibits trypanocidal activity. It has a role as a trypanocidal drug and a plant metabolite. It is a trihydroxyflavone, an acetate ester, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a kaempferol O-glucoside. It derives from a kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside.
