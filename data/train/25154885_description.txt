The molecule is a gamma-lactone that is dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one substituted by a hydroxyethyl group at position 3 and a methyl group at position 4 (the 3R,4S,1'R stereoisomer). Isolated from an edible mushroom Mycoleptodonoides aitchisonii, it exhibits protective activity against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress dependent cell death. It has a role as a metabolite and a neuroprotective agent. It is a gamma-lactone and a secondary alcohol.
