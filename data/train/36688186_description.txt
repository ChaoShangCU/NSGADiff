The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion that is a trianion arising from deprotonation of phosphate and carboxylic acid functions of 6-phospho-D-gluconic acid. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite. It is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion, a monocarboxylic acid anion and an organophosphate oxoanion. It is a conjugate base of a 6-phospho-D-gluconic acid and a 6-phospho-D-gluconate.
