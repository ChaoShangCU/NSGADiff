The molecule is a lactam that is 4-hydroxyazacyclotetradecan-2-one substituted by an ethyl group at position 11, methyl group at positions 3 and 7 and a 3,6-dideoxy-3-(methylamino)-alpha-L-talopyranosyl moiety at position 4 via a glycosyl linkage (the 3R,4S,7R,11S stereoisomer). It is isolated from the fermentation broth of Nonomuraea turkmeniaca MA7364 and exhibits anthelminthic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an anthelminthic drug. It is an aminoglycoside, a lactam and a macrocycle. It derives from a fluvirucin A1.
