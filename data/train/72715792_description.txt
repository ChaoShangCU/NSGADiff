The molecule is a tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of a D-glucosyl residue beta-linked to a 3-aminopropyloxy group and which carries at O-3 a beta-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-alpha-L-rhamnosyl linear trisaccharide unit. It contains a beta-D-Manp-(1->3)-beta-D-Manp-(1->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp-yl group.
