The molecule is a steroidal acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,24-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,24-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oyl-CoA(4-).
