The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->6) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-GalpNAc and an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
