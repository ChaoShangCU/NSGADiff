The molecule is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid that is 2-oxobutanoic acid which is substituted by a phosphonooxy group at position 4 and a hydroxy group at the 3-pro-R position. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid, a 3-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a carboxyalkyl phosphate, an oxoalkyl phosphate, a hydroxyalkyl phosphate and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a butyric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (R)-3-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-(phosphonatoooxy)butanoate.
