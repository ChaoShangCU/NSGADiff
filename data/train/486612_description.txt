The molecule is a lignan that is (-)-matairesinol in which one of the phenolic hydroxy groups has been replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a gamma-lactone, a lignan, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a member of guaiacols. It derives from a (-)-matairesinol.
