The molecule is a trienoic fatty acid consisting of (8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid having additional (7R)-hydroxy- and (5S,6S)-epoxy groups. It is an epoxy fatty acid, a hydroxy fatty acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, a long-chain fatty acid and an icosanoid. It derives from an all-cis-icosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7R)-hydroxy-(5S,6S)-epoxy-(8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoate.
