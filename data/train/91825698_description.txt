The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising a linear tetrasaccharide chain of alpha-N-acetylneuramine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and alpha-D-mannose residues linked sequentially (2->3), (1->4) and (1->2), to the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue of which is also linked (1->3) an alpha-L-fucose residue. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
