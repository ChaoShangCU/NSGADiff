The molecule is an acyl-CoA oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of trans-dec-2-enoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a 4,5-saturated-trans-2-enoyl-CoA(4-). It derives from a (2E)-decenoate. It is a conjugate base of a trans-dec-2-enoyl-CoA.
