The molecule is a perfluorinated compound that is 2-propoxypentanoic acid in which all 11 of the hydrogens attached to carbon atoms have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Used as an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid in the fluoropolymer industry for years, its widespread environmental distribution, high bioaccumulation capability, and human exposure have caused great concern, particularly as its potential toxicity and health risk is still largely unknown. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a perfluorinated compound and an ether.
