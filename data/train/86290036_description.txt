The molecule is a spiroketal and delta-lactone resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of L-glutamine with the anomeric hydroxy group of D-fructose and substitution of the 1-hydroxy group of the fructose by the alpha-amino group of the glutamine. It is found in crown gall tumours induced in chrysanthemums by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a spiroketal, a carboxamide, a delta-lactone, a triol, a secondary amino compound and an amino acid opine. It derives from a L-glutamine and a D-fructopyranose.
