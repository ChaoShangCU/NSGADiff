The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 5-hydroxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatetraenoic acid. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 5-HETE. It is a conjugate acid of a 5-hydroxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
