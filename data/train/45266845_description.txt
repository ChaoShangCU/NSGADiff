The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of the linear sequence beta-D-GalNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-Glc having a Neu5Ac residue attached to the galactose via an alpha-(2->3) linkage. Corresponds to the carbohydrate portion of ganglioside GM2. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
