The molecule is a ginsenoside found in Panax species that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 6alpha, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy group at position 6 has been converted to the corresponding alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a cardioprotective agent and an anticoagulant. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a 12beta-hydroxy steroid, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a disaccharide derivative, a 20-hydroxy steroid and a 3beta-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylsteroid. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
