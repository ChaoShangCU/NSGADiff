The molecule is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid that is chelidonine substituted by a methyl group at position 13. Isolated from the aerial parts of Corydalis incisa, it acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and also exhibits antineoplastic and hepatoprotective activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and a hepatoprotective agent. It is a member of isoquinolines, an organic heterohexacyclic compound, a secondary alcohol, a cyclic acetal and a benzophenanthridine alkaloid. It derives from a chelidonine.
