The molecule is a quercetin O-glucoside that is quercetin attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a quercetin O-glucoside, a tetrahydroxyflavone and a tetrasaccharide derivative.
