The molecule is a long-chain trienoic fatty acid consisting of octadecanoic acid having the three double bonds at positions 9, 11 and 15 as well as an epoxy ring linking positions 12 and 13. It is an epoxy fatty acid, a long-chain fatty acid and a trienoic fatty acid. It derives from a 9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,13S,15Z)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoate.
