The molecule is a member of the class of phenoxazines that is 1,9-dimethyl-3H-phenoxazin-3-one carrying an additional hydroxy substituent at position 7 as well as two 2,4-dihydroxy-6-methylphenyl substituents at positions 2 and 8. The isomer in which the hydroxy groups at positions 2' and 2'' on the phenyl rings are both on the same side of the plane of the phenoxazine ring system. A component of orcein, a mixture of dyes isolated from lichens. It has a role as a food colouring, a histological dye and a plant metabolite. It is a cyclic ketone, a phenoxazine, a polyphenol and a member of resorcinols.
