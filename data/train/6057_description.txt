The molecule is an optically active form of tyrosine having L-configuration. It has a role as an EC 1.3.1.43 (arogenate dehydrogenase) inhibitor, a nutraceutical, a micronutrient and a fundamental metabolite. It is an erythrose 4-phosphate/phosphoenolpyruvate family amino acid, a proteinogenic amino acid, a tyrosine and a L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a L-tyrosinal. It is a conjugate base of a L-tyrosinium. It is a conjugate acid of a L-tyrosinate(1-). It is an enantiomer of a D-tyrosine. It is a tautomer of a L-tyrosine zwitterion.
