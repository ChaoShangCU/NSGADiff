The molecule is an aromatic ketone that is 2-benzoylcyclohexane-1,3-dione in which the phenyl group is substituted at positions 2, 3, and 4 by chlorine, (2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)methyl, and methylsulfonyl groups, respectively. It is a post-emergence herbicide used (particularly in conjunction with the herbicide safener cyprosulfamide) for the control of a wide range of broad-leaved and grassy weeds in corn and other crops. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical, an EC 1.13.11.27 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitor and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a sulfone, a cyclic ketone, an aromatic ketone, a member of monochlorobenzenes, an organofluorine compound, an ether and a beta-triketone.
