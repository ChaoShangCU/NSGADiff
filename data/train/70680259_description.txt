The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is the cinnamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of trans-4-coumaric acid with the hydroxy group at position 3 of actinidic acid (the 2alpha,3beta stereoisomer). It is isolated from the roots of Actinidia arguta and exhibits inhibitory activity towards pancreatic lipase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.1.1.3 (triacylglycerol lipase) inhibitor. It is a cinnamate ester, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a secondary alcohol and a primary alcohol. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid and an actinidic acid.
