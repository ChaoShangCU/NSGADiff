The molecule is a flavone C-glycoside that is fisetin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 8 via a C-glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a flavone C-glycoside, a tetrahydroxyflavone, a 3'-hydroxyflavonoid and a 7-hydroxyflavonol. It derives from a fisetin.
