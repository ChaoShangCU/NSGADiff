The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is eriodictyol substituted by a 2-O-(6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a neohesperidoside, a disaccharide derivative, a trihydroxyflavanone, a flavanone glycoside and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from an eriodictyol.
