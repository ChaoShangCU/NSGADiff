The molecule is a withanolide that is 22,26-epoxyergosta-1,4,24-triene-18-al substituted by oxo groups at positions 3 and 26. Isolated from a Formosan soft coral, Paraminabea acronocephala, it exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as a coral metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is an ergostanoid, a withanolide, a delta-lactone, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid and a steroid aldehyde.
