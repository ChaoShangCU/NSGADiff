The molecule is a docosanoid that is (4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying a hydroperoxy substituent at position 14. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosa-4,7,10,13,16-pentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (4Z,7Z,10Z,12E,16Z)-14-hydroperoxydocosapentaenoate.
