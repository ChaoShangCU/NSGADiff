The molecule is a carboxylic ester obtained by the formal condensation of (2aR,7R,8aS)-7-heptyl-4-methyl-2,2a,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-1H-5,6,8b-triazaacenaphthylene-3-carboxylic acid with the hydroxy group of 4-carbamimidamidobutyl 3-(9-hydroxynonyl)-1-imino-1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-c]pyrimidine-4-carboxylate. Isolated from a bright red Caribbean sponge, Batzella, it has potential anti-HIV activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an anti-HIV-1 agent. It is a member of guanidines, an alkaloid, an organic heterotricyclic compound, a carboxylic ester, a pyrrolopyrimidine and a triazaacenaphthylene.
