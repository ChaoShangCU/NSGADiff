The molecule is an S-conjugate in which the mercapto hydrogen of L-cysteinylglycine has been replaced by an N-hydroxy-2-(indol-3-yl)ethanimidoyl group. It is a N-hydroxyimidothioate, a S-conjugate, a dipeptide and a member of indoles. It derives from a L-cysteinylglycine. It is a tautomer of a S-[(E)-N-hydroxy-2-(indol-3-yl)ethanimidoyl]-L-cysteinylglycine zwitterion.
