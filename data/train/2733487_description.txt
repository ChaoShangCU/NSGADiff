The molecule is a diester that results from the condensation of the 1-carboxy groups of two molecules of propane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid with hydroxy groups at positions 14 and 15 of (2S,3S,5R,10R,12S,14S,15R,16R)-2-amino-12,16-dimethylicosane-3,5,10,14,15-pentol. It has a role as a metabolite and a carcinogenic agent. It is a fumonisin, a primary amino compound, a diester and a triol. It derives from a (2S,3S,5R,10R,12S,14S,15R,16R)-2-amino-12,16-dimethylicosane-3,5,10,14,15-pentol. It is a conjugate acid of a fumonisin B1(3-).
