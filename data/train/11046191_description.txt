The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosa-4,7,10,13,15,19-hexaenoic acid carrying a hydroxy substituent at the 17S-position. It is a metabolite of docosahexaenoic acid in human blood and mouse brain, and serves as a precursor to 17(S)-resolvins. It has a role as a mouse metabolite, an animal metabolite and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is an enantiomer of a 17(R)-HDoHE.
