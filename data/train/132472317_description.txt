The molecule is a docosanoid that is 17(R)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,10,12,14,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid in which a cysteinylglycinyl group is attached at position 16S via a sulfide linkage. An intermediate of specialized proresolving mediators It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a specialised pro-resolving mediator. It is a docosanoid, an organic sulfide, a secondary alcohol, a dipeptide and a dicarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 16(S)-glycinylcystein-S-yl-17(R)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,10,12,14,19Z)-docosahexaenoate(1-).
