The molecule is a (7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-17-hydroperoxydocosapentaenoic acid in which the chiral centre at position 17 has S-configuration. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid and a docosanoid. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,17S,19Z)-17-hydroperoxydocosapentaenoate.
