The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is the carboxylic ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of hederagenin with beta-D-glucopyranose. It has been isolated from Juglans sinensis. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a carboxylic ester. It derives from a hederagenin. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
