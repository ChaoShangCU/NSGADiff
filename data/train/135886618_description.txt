The molecule is a hydrochloride salt resulting from the formal reaction of equimolar amounts of quininib and hydrogen chloride. It is an anti-angiogenic compound that exerts a dose-dependent antagonism of the cysteinyl leukotriene pathway, preferentially antagonising cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1. It has a role as an angiogenesis inhibitor. It contains a quininib(1+).
