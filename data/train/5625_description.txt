The molecule is the amide resulting from the formal condensation of 5-[(methylsulfonyl)amino]-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid and 4-amino group of 1-[3-(isopropylamino)pyridin-2-yl]piperazine, delavirdine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with activity specific for HIV-1. Viral resistance emerges rapidly when delavirdine is used alone, so it is therefore used (as the methanesulfonic acid salt) with other antiretrovirals for combination therapy of HIV infection. It has a role as a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an antiviral drug. It is a N-acylpiperazine, a sulfonamide, an aminopyridine and an indolecarboxamide.
