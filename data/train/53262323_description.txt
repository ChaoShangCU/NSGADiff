The molecule is a linear amino pentasaccharide consisting of the tetrasaccharide beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine having an alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl residue attached at the 3-position of the galactosyl residue at the non-reducing end. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
