The molecule is a branched amino octasaccharide comprising a sequence of alpha-sialyl, beta-D-galactosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl, alpha-D-mannosyl, beta-D-mannosyl, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues linked respectively (2->6), (1->4), (1->2), (1->3), (1->4) and (1->4), to the beta-D-mannosyl residue of which is also linked (1->6) a further alpha-D-mannosyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino octasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
