The molecule is a steroid saponin that is ergosta-7,24(28)-diene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 2, a methyl group at position 4, a carboxy group at position 21 and a alpha-L-quinovopyranosyloxy group at position 3 (the 2alpha,3beta,4alpha,5alpha stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the roots of Breynia fruticosa. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a steroid acid, a steroid saponin, a deoxyglucose derivative, a monosaccharide derivative and a monocarboxylic acid.
