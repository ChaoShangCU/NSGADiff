The molecule is the conjugate base of ketomycolic acid type-3 (XIII'). A class of mycolic acids characterized by the presence of a proximal cis C=C double bond followed by a cis-cyclopropyl group, a distal oxo group and a (CH-CH3) fragment of (S) stereochemistry in the meromycolic chain. It is a mycolate, a branched-chain fatty acid anion and an oxo fatty acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a ketomycolic acid type-3 (XIII').
