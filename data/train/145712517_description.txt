The molecule is a methyl glycoside that is beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-[beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-Glc-(1->6)]-beta-D-GlcNAc in which the hydroxy group at position 6 of the galactose residue linked to O-4 of the reducing end glucosyl residue is replaced by an ammoniumyl group and the hydroxy group at the reducing-end anomeric centre is methylated. It contains an azaniumyl group. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->6)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
