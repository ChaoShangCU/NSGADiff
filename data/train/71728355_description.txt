The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5 and 4', and a (6''-O-(3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy residue at position 7. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a gallate ester, a dihydroxyflavanone and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones.
