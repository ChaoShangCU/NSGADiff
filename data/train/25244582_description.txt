The molecule is an acyl-CoA oxoanion that is the tetraanion of myristoyl-CoA, arising from deprotonation of phosphate and diphosphate functions. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a myristoyl-CoA.
