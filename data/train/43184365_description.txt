The molecule is any one of a class of diblock copolymers with a structure consisting of a primary amino group attached to the end of a polyether backbone based on blocks of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide. Molecular weights are typically of the order of 600-2000. The compounds are used in protein crystallisation. It has a role as a crystallisation adjutant.
