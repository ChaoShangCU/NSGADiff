The molecule is an L-isoleucine derivative resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (+)-7-isojasmonic acid with the amino group of L-isoleucine. It has a role as a member of jasmonates and a plant metabolite. It is a L-isoleucine derivative, a N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid and a fatty amide. It derives from a (+)-7-isojasmonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-[(+)-7-isojasmonyl]-L-isoleucinate.
