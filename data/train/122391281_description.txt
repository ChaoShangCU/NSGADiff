The molecule is a docosanoid that is (7Z,11Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at positions 10 and 17. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid, a lipid hydroperoxide and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,11Z,13Z,15E,19Z)-10,17-bis(hydroperoxy)docosapentaenoate.
