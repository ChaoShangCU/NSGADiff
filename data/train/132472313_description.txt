The molecule is a docosanoid that is (8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 7R and 14S. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a secondary allylic alcohol, a docosanoid, a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid and a long-chain fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7R,14S)-dihydroxy-(8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoate.
