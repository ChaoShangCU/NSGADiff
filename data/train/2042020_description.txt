The molecule is a doubly-charged N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid anion resulting from deprotonation of both carboxy groups of N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid. It has a role as an antioxidant, a human metabolite, a mouse metabolite and a rat metabolite. It is a N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid anion and a dicarboxylic acid dianion. It derives from a L-aspartate(2-). It is a conjugate base of a N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid.
