The molecule is a synthetic phenylalanine derivative derived formally from the mycotoxin ochratoxin A by replacement of the methyl group at position 3 of the isochromene ring with a 4-carboxybutyl group. It has a role as a hapten. It is a N-acyl-L-phenylalanine, a member of isochromanes, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an organochlorine compound and a diastereoisomeric mixture. It derives from an ochratoxin A.
