The molecule is an organic heteropentacyclic compound that is 5b,7,8,16-tetrahydro-6H,10H-pyrrolo[2,1-c]quinazolino[3,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepine substituted by a methoxy group at position 2 and oxo groups at positions 10 and 16 (the 5bS stereoisomer). An alkaloid isolated from the culture broth of Aspergillus ochraceus, it exhibits potent inhibitory activity towards mitochondrial NADH oxidase. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 1.6.* (oxidoreductase acting on NADH or NADPH) inhibitor and an Aspergillus metabolite. It is an alkaloid, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, an aromatic ether and a lactam.
