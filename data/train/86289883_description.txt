The molecule is a dipeptide that is beta-alanyl-L-lysine in which the amino group at position 6 of the lysine has been acylated by formal condensation with (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)acetic acid. Being fluorescent, it can be used as a reporter molecule for studying the oligopeptide transport system in brain cell cultures. It has a role as a fluorescent probe. It is a dipeptide and a member of 7-aminocoumarins.
