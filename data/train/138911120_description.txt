The molecule is an ammonium ion resulting from the protonation of the tertiary amino group of (+)-echitovenine. The major species at pH 7.3. Note the stereoconfiguration of the 19 hydroxy group is based on CHEBI:144371 (and Fig. S10). It is an indole alkaloid cation and an ammonium ion derivative. It is an enantiomer of a (-)-echitovenine(1+).
