The molecule is a guaiacyl lignin that is guaiacylglycerol in which the hydrogen on the 2-hydroxy function has been replaced by a 4-(1,2,3-trihydroxypropan-1-yl)-2,6-dimethoxyphenyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a guaiacyl lignin, a member of phenols, a dimethoxybenzene, a secondary alcohol and a primary alcohol. It derives from a guaiacylglycerol.
