The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridine-4-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 5-{[(5-tert-butyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)methyl]sulfanyl}-1,3-thiazol-2-amine. A CDKL2 inhibitor (Kd = 63nM). It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of 1,3-oxazoles, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, an organic sulfide, a secondary carboxamide, a member of pyridines and a N-methylpiperazine.
