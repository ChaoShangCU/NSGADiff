The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-beta-D-galactopyranose, alpha-D-galactopyranose and D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from an alpha-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Gal.
