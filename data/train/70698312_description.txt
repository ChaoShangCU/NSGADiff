The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide consisting of a sequence of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, alpha-D-mannose, beta-D-mannose and two N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues linked (1->4), (1->2), (1->6), (1->4) and (1->4), with an alpha-D-mannose linked (1->3) to the beta-D-mannose residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino heptasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
