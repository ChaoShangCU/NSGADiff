The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-oxo-octacosanoic acid (3-oxomontanoic acid). It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-oxo-octacosanoyl-CoA(4-).
