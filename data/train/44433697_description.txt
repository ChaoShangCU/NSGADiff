The molecule is a tripeptide that is L-seryl-L-valyl-L-leucine in which the amino group at the N-terminal is substituted by a tert-butoxycarbonyl group and the carboxy group at the C-terminal is substituted by a {(2S,3E)-5-ethoxy-5-oxo-1-[(3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]pent-3-en-2-yl}amino group. It is a 3C-like protease inhibitor of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. It has a role as an anticoronaviral agent and an EC 3.4.22.69 (SARS coronavirus main proteinase) inhibitor. It is a tripeptide, a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones, a tert-butyl ester, an ethyl ester, an enoate ester and a secondary carboxamide.
