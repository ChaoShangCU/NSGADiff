The molecule is the dihydrate form of enalaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that is used (often in the form of its prodrug, enalapril) in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, for reduction of proteinuria and renal disease in patients with nephropathies, and for the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death in high-risk patients. Unlike enalapril, enalaprilat is not absorbed by mouth but is administered by intravenous injection. It has a role as an EC 3.4.15.1 (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) inhibitor and an antihypertensive agent. It contains an enalaprilat (anhydrous).
