The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is 29-nordammara-1,17(20)-diene substituted by acetoxy groups at positions 6 and 16, a carboxy group at position 21, a hydroxy group at position 25 and oxo groups at positions 3 and 7 respectively. It is isolated from the marine-derived fungal strain Aspergillus sydowii PFW1-13 and exhibits antibacterial activity. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, an acetate ester, a tertiary alcohol, an oxo monocarboxylic acid, a cyclic ketone, a 3-oxo-Delta(1) steroid and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid.
