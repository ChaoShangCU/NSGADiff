The molecule is a monosaccharide derivative resulting from the formal condensation of the hydroxy group of 2-methyl-4-oxo-4H-pyran-3-yl beta-D-glucopyranoside with the carboxy group of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, a tertiary alcohol, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone, a beta-D-glucose and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid.
