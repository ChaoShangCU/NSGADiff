The molecule is a tetracyclic diterpenoid isolated originally from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia. It is a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy. Note that the use of the former generic name 'taxol' is now limited, as Taxol is a registered trade mark. It has a role as a microtubule-stabilising agent, a metabolite, a human metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a tetracyclic diterpenoid and a taxane diterpenoid. It derives from a baccatin III.
