The molecule is uDP-glycopeptide having N-acetylmuramoyl as the glyco portion and L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine as the peptide portion (attached via an amide bond between the amino terminus and the muramoyl carboxy group). It is a conjugate acid of an UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine(3-).
