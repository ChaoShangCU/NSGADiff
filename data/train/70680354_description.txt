The molecule is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA obtained from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (E)-isoheptadec-2-enoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of an (E)-isoheptadec-2-enoyl-CoA(4-).
