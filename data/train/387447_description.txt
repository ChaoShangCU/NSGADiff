The molecule is l-Phenylalaninamide substituted at the amide nitrogen by a 1-(dihydroxyboranyl)-3-methylbutyl group and at N(alpha) by a pyrazin-2-ylcarbonyl group. It is a dipeptidyl boronic acid that reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a proteasome inhibitor, a protease inhibitor and an antiprotozoal drug. It is an amino acid amide, a member of pyrazines and a L-phenylalanine derivative. It derives from a boronic acid.
