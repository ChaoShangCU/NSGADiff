The molecule is an aroyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoic acid. It derives from a benzoyl-CoA and a 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoyl-CoA(4-).
