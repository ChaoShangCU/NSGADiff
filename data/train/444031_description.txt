The molecule is 2-[(3S)-1-Ethylpyrrolidin-3-yl]-2,2-diphenylacetamide in which one of the hydrogens at the 2-position of the ethyl group is substituted by a 2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-5-yl group. It is a selective antagonist for the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is primarily responsible for bladder muscle contractions, and is used as the hydrobromide salt in the management of urinary incontinence. It has a role as a muscarinic antagonist and an antispasmodic drug. It is a member of 1-benzofurans, a member of pyrrolidines and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
