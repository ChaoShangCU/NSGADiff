The molecule is a member of the class of 2,5-diketopiperazines that is 2,5-diketopiperazine which is substituted at positions 3 and 6 by 3-(hydroxyamino)propyl groups in which the nitrogens have been acylated by (2E)-5-hydroxy-3-methylpent-2-enoyl groups. The substituent at position 3 has been further modified by having its terminal hydroxy group esterified by condensation with the carboxy group of N(2)-acetyl-N(5)-hydroxy-L-ornithine in which the N(5) nitrogen has been acylated by a (2E)-5-hydroxy-3-methylpent-2-enoyl group. It has a role as a siderophore. It is a hydroxamic acid, a carboxylic ester, a primary alcohol, a member of acetamides, a member of 2,5-diketopiperazines and a homoallylic alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of a desferricoprogen(3-).
