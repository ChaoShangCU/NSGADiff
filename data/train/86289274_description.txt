The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,9Z)-octadecadienoic acid. It is a trans-2-enoyl-CoA, an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA and an octadecadienoyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,9Z)-octadecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
