The molecule is a dithiocarbamic ester that is 1,3,5-thiadiazinane with a thione moiety at position 2 and in which the hydrogens attached to the nitrogens are replaced by methyl groups. A fungicide, herbicide and nematicide, it is used prior to sowing or planting for the control of soil fungi, nematodes, bacteria and germinating weeds, and as fumigant for poultry litter and eggs to control Salmonella. It is a non-ozone-depleting alternative to methyl bromide. It has a role as a herbicide, a nematicide, an antibacterial agent and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a dithiocarbamic ester and a thiadiazinane.
