The molecule is an organic sodium salt having 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate as the counterion. A membrane permeable cGMP analogue that activates protein kinase G (PKG). It is 4.3-fold more potent than cGMP in activating PKG1alpha and promotes relaxation of tracheal and vascular smooth muscle tissue in vitro. It has a role as a protein kinase G agonist and a muscle relaxant. It contains an 8-bromo-3',5'-cyclic GMP(1-).
