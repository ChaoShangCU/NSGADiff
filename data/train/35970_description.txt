The molecule is an organosulfur heterocyclic compound that is 1,2,3-trithiane in which one of the hydrogens at position 5 has been replaced by a dimethylamino group. A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, it was used (particularly as its hydrogen oxalate salt, known as thyocyclam oxalate) as a broad-spectrum insecticide, but it is also toxic to bees, fish and other aquatic organisms. It is not approved for use within the European Union. It has a role as an agrochemical and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. It is a nereistoxin analogue insecticide and an organosulfur heterocyclic compound. It is a conjugate base of a thiocyclam(1+). It derives from a hydride of a 1,2,3-trithiane.
