The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid isolated from the sponge Dysidea sp. that is 5-amino-2-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone in which one of the hydrogens of the methyl group is replaced by a 1,2,4a,5-tetramethyl-1,2,3,4,4a,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen-2-yl group and one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a 2-sulfoethyl group. Dysidine selectively inhibits human synovial phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) with an IC50 = 2.0 muM. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.1.1.4 (phospholipase A2) inhibitor. It is a secondary amino compound, an organosulfonic acid, a sesquiterpenoid, a member of monohydroxy-1,4-benzoquinones and a member of octahydronaphthalenes.
