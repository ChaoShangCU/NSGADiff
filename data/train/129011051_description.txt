The molecule is a glycoside that consists of an N-formyl-2-O-methyl-alpha-D-perosamine residue and two N-formyl-alpha-D-perosamine residues linked sequentially (1->2) and (1->3) and linked at the reducing end glycosidically to a 5-(methoxycarbonyl)pentyl group. It is a methyl ester, a glycoside and a trisaccharide derivative.
