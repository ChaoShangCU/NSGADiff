The molecule is a diastereoisomeric mixture comprising equimolar amounts of (1R,2S)- and (1R,2R)-diclocymet. A fungicide used for the control of rice blast in paddy fields. It also shows some activity against paddy field insect pests including rice water weevil and rice-stem borer. Diclocymet is moderately toxic to fish. It has a role as a xenobiotic, an insecticide, a melanin synthesis inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a diastereoisomeric mixture and an amide fungicide. It contains a (1R,2S)-diclocymet and a (1R,2R)-diclocymet.
