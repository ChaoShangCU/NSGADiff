The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the carboxy and phosphate groups of archaeal dolichyl beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->4)-alpha-D-glucosyl phosphate; major species at pH 7.3. Dolichol used by archaea is is generally much shorter (C55-C60) than that used by eukaryotes and may have additional saturation positions in the chain. It is an organophosphate oxoanion and a carbohydrate acid derivative anion. It derives from an archaeal dolichol.
