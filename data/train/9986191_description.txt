The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol substituted by a 2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a trihydroxyflavone and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from a kaempferol.
