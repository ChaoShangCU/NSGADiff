The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol attached to alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residues at positions 3 and 7 respectively via glycosidic linkages. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Vicia faba and Lotus edulis. It has a role as a bone density conservation agent, a hypoglycemic agent, an immunomodulator, an anti-inflammatory agent, an antineoplastic agent, a plant metabolite, an apoptosis inducer and an antidepressant. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a dihydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone and a polyphenol. It derives from a kaempferol.
