The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide that is beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)]-D-GalpNAc in which the beta-D-galactosyl group attached by a (1->4) linkage to an acetamidoglucopyranosyl group has glycosylated at its 3-hydroxy group by an alpha-D-galactopyransyl group. It is an amino sugar, an amino pentasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)]-D-GalpNAc.
