The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide consisting of alpha-sialyl, beta-D-galactosyl,N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues connected sequentially by (2->6), (1->4), (1->3 and (1->4)) linkages. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
