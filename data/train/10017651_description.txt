The molecule is a hydrochloride resulting from the reaction of (S,S)-tramadol with 1 molar equivalent of hydrogen chloride; the (S,S)-enantiomer of the racemic opioid analgesic tramadol hydrochloride, it exhibits ten-fold lower analgesic potency than the (R,R)-enantiomer. It has a role as a delta-opioid receptor agonist, a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an adrenergic uptake inhibitor, an antitussive, a capsaicin receptor antagonist, a muscarinic antagonist, a NMDA receptor antagonist, an opioid analgesic, a serotonergic antagonist and a serotonin uptake inhibitor. It contains a (S,S)-tramadol(1+). It is an enantiomer of a (R,R)-tramadol hydrochloride.
