The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranose, alpha-D-galactopyranose and beta-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Galp.
