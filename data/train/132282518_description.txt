The molecule is a homodetic cyclic peptide containing a 28-membered ring and consisting of 3-methyl-N-[(2E,4Z)-8-methylnona-2,4-dienoyl]-L-alpha-aspartyl, (2S)-2,3-diaminobutanoyl, D-valyl, L-lysyl, 3-hydroxy-L-alpha-aspartyl, L-alpha-aspartyl, glycyl, 3-methyl-D-alpha-aspartyl, L-valyl, and (4R)-methyl-L-proline joined in sequence and cyclised by condensation of the beta-amino group of the 2,3-diaminobutanoyl residue with the carboxy group of the 4-methylproline residue. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, a member of calcium-dependent antibiotics and an antibacterial agent. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide and a lipopeptide.
