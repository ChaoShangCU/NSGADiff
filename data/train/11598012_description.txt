The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is 5alpha-lanosta-8-ene with an epoxy group across positions 24 and 25, a hydroxy group at position 26 and oxo groups at positions 3 and 7. Isolated from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma pfeifferi, it exhibits antiviral activity against influenza A virus. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.2.1.18 (exo-alpha-sialidase) inhibitor. It is a diketone, a primary alcohol, a tetracyclic triterpenoid and an epoxide. It derives from a hydride of a lanostane.
