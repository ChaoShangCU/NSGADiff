The molecule is a hydrochloride resulting from the combination of equimolar amounts of midodrine and hydrogen chloride. Midodrine is a direct-acting sympathomimetic with selective alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. The hydrochloride salt is used as a peripheral vasoconstrictor in the treatment of certain hypotensive states. The main active moiety is its major metabolite, deglymidodrine. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent and a vasoconstrictor agent. It contains a midodrine(1+).
