The molecule is a pyrazolone that is 5-methyl-4-methylene-2-(p-carboxyphenyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one in which the exocyclic carbon of the methylene group is attached to a 5-(4,5-dimethyl-2-nitrophenyl)furan-2-yl group by a single bond. C646 is a potent, cell permeable and selective competitive inhibitor of p300 and CBP (p300/CBP) histone acetyltransferases. It has a role as an EC 2.3.1.48 (histone acetyltransferase) inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer and a radiosensitizing agent. It is a member of furans, a biaryl, a pyrazolone, a member of benzoic acids and a C-nitro compound.
