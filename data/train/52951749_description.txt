The molecule is a homoflavonoid glycoside that is ophioglonol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from Ophioglossum pedunculosum. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a homoflavonoid glycoside, a hydroxy homoflavonoid and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from an ophioglonol.
