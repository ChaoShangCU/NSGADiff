The molecule is a diazepinoindole that is 8-amino-4,5-dihydro-6H-[1,2]diazepino[4,5,6-cd]indol-6-one which is substituted at position 2 by a 1-methylpyrazol-4-yl group and in which the amino group at position 8 has undergone condensation with the carboxy group of (2R)-2-cyclohexylglycine to give the corresponding carboxamide. It is an inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1). It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.1 (non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is an amino acid amide, a member of pyrazoles and a diazepinoindole.
