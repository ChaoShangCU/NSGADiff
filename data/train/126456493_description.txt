The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid that is 16alpha-hydroxyestrone in which the phenolic hydrogen has been replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It is a steroid glucosiduronic acid, a 16alpha-hydroxy steroid, a 17-oxo steroid, a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a 16alpha-hydroxyestrone. It is a conjugate acid of a 16alpha-hydroxyestrone 3-O-(beta-D-glucuronide)(1-).
