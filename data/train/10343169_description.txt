The molecule is a xanthone glycoside that is the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro derivaive of swertianolin (the S,4R-stereoisomer). It is isolated from Swertia japonica and shows hepatoprotective properties. It has a role as a hepatoprotective agent and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, an aromatic ether and a xanthone glycoside. It derives from a swertianolin.
