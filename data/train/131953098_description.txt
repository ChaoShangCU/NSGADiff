The molecule is a retinoid that is 5,6-epoxyretinoic acid in which the carboxy proton has been replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It has a role as a rat metabolite. It is a retinoid, a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid and an epoxide. It derives from a 5,6-epoxyretinoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 1-O-(5,6-epoxyretinoyl)-beta-D-glucuronate.
