The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2E,4E)-tetradecadienoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a trans,trans-2,4-dienoyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2E,4E)-tetradecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
