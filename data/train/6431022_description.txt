The molecule is a cyclopentapyran that is (4aR,7aS)-1,4a,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrocyclopenta[c]pyran substituted at position 1 by an oxo group and at positions 4 and 7 by methyl groups, respectively (the 4aR,7S,7aS-diastereomer). An iridoid monoterpenoid isolated from several Nepeta plant species. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a cyclopentapyran and an iridoid monoterpenoid.
