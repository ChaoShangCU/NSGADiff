The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of a tetrasaccharide chain of alpha-D-glucose, alpha-L-rhamnose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and alpha-L-rhamnose residues linked sequentially (1->4), (1->3) and (1->2), to the non-reducing rhamnose residue of which is also linked (1->3) a further alpha-L-rhamnose residue. Derived from the Shigella liposaccharide O-antigen, it shows antigenic properties. It has a role as an antigen.
