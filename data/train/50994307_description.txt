The molecule is a tirucallane triterpenoid that is (13alpha,14beta,17alpha,20S)-lanosta-7,24-diene substituted by an oxo group at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 23 (the 23S stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the stem and stem barks of Cornus walteri. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a tirucallane triterpenoid, a cyclic terpene ketone and an ether.
