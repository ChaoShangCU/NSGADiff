The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprising a linear trisaccharide of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues linked sequentially (1->3) and (1->4), to the galactose residue of which is also linked (1->6) a linear N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl string. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
