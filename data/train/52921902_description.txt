The molecule is a glutathione conjugate in which the thiol hydrogen of glutathione has been replaced by a (6S,7R,8E,10S,12Z,15Z)-19-carboxy-6,10-dihydroxynonadeca-8,12,15-trien-7-yl group. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a glutathione conjugate and a fatty acid derivative. It is a conjugate acid of an 11(S),15(S)-dihydroxy-14(R)-(S-glutathionyl)-5(Z),8(Z),12(E)-icosatrienoate(2-).
