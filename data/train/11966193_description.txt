The molecule is an (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (R)-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. It derives from an octanoyl-CoA and a (R)-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (R)-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA(4-).
