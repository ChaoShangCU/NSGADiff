The molecule is an N-acyl-amino acid resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of gamma-aminobutyric acid with the carboxy group of (12S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoic acid. It has a role as a mammalian metabolite. It is a fatty amide, a lipid hydroperoxide and a N-acyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid. It derives from a 12(S)-HPETE. It is a conjugate acid of a N-[(12S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-icosatetraenoyl]-gamma-aminobutanoate.
