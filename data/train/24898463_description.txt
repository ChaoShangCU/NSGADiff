The molecule is a tricyclic triterpenoid that is 3,4-secolanosta-8,24-diene-3,26-dioic acid 3-methylester substituted by acetoxy groups at positions 19 and 22 and a hydroxy group at position 4. It is isolated from the fruiting bodies of the Vietnamese mushroom Ganoderma colossum and displays inhibitory activity towards the enzyme HIV protease. It has a role as a HIV protease inhibitor and a fungal metabolite. It is an acetate ester, a tertiary alcohol, a tricyclic triterpenoid, a dicarboxylic acid monoester and a methyl ester. It derives from a hydride of a lanostane.
