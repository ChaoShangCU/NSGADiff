The molecule is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride obtained by condensation of one of the carboxy group of pyridinium-3,5-biscarboxylic acid mononucleotide with the phosphste group of AMP. It is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride, a pyridine nucleotide and an adenosine 5'-phosphate. It derives from an adenosine 5'-monophosphate and a pyridinium-3,5-biscarboxylic acid mononucleotide. It is a conjugate acid of a 5-carboxy-1-(5-O-phosphono-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyridinium-3-carbonyl adenylate(3-).
