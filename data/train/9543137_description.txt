The molecule is a 3-oxoacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 2-hydroxy-6-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA and a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a cyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-hydroxy-6-oxocyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA(4-).
