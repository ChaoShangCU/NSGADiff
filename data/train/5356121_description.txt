The molecule is a member of the class of chalcones that consists of trans-chalcone substituted by hydroxy group at positions 2' and methoxy groups at positions 4' and 6'. Isolated from Piper methysticum and Piper rusbyi, it exhibits antileishmanial, anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic activities. It has a role as a metabolite, an antileishmanial agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of chalcones, a dimethoxybenzene and a member of phenols. It derives from a trans-chalcone.
