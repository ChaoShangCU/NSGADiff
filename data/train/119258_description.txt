The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (+)-taxifolin substituted by a alpha-L-rhamnosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a radical scavenger, an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a member of 3'-hydroxyflavanones, a tetrahydroxyflavanone, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from a (+)-taxifolin. It is an enantiomer of a neoastilbin.
