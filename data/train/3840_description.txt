The molecule is a pyranone that is 4H-pyran substituted by a hydroxy group at position 5, a hydroxymethyl group at position 2 and an oxo group at position 4. It has been isolated from the fungus Aspergillus oryzae. It has a role as a NF-kappaB inhibitor, an Aspergillus metabolite, a skin lightening agent, an EC 1.10.3.1 (catechol oxidase) inhibitor, an EC 1.10.3.2 (laccase) inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.24 (quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase) inhibitor, an EC 1.14.18.1 (tyrosinase) inhibitor and an EC 1.4.3.3 (D-amino-acid oxidase) inhibitor. It is an enol, a primary alcohol and a member of 4-pyranones. It derives from a hydride of a 4H-pyran.
