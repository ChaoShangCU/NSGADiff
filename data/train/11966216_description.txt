The molecule is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (S)-3-hydroxyoctanoic acid and an octanoyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA(4-).
