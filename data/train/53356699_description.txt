The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide consisting of the linear sequence alpha-L-Fuc-(1->2)-beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GalNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc having a Neu5Ac residue attached to the inner galactose via an alpha-(2->3) linkage. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
