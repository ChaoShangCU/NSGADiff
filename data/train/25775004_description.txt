The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is benzoic acid substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3 and a (2S)-2-hydroxy-6-methylheptan-2-yl group at position 4. It has been isolated from the sea fan derived fungus Aspergillus sydowii. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a sesquiterpenoid, a monohydroxybenzoic acid and an aromatic alcohol.
