The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide that is 2-acetamido-3-O-(2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose in which the 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety has been glycosylated at positions 3 and 4 by alpha-L-fucosyl and beta-D-galactopyranosyl groups, respectively. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc and an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)]-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
