The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is cucurbitacin I attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 2 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from Machilus yaoshansis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a cucurbitacin, a monosaccharide derivative, a triterpenoid saponin and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a cucurbitacin I.
