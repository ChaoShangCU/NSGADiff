The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin with gypsogenin as the aglycone species. It is isolated from the roots of Gypsophila oldhamiana and exhibits inhibitory activity against pancreatic lipase. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.3 (triacylglycerol lipase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, an aldehyde, a triterpenoid saponin and a methyl ester. It derives from a gypsogenin. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
