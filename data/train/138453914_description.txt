The molecule is a terpene glycoside that is beta-D-glucopyranose in which the hydrogen of the hydroxy group at position 1R is replaced by a (4R,4aR,6R,7R,7aS)-4,7-dimethyl-1-oxooctahydrocyclopenta[c]pyran-6-yl group. It is a plant metabolite isolated from Nepeta cataria. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a terpene glycoside, an iridoid monoterpenoid, a beta-D-glucoside and an organic heterobicyclic compound.
