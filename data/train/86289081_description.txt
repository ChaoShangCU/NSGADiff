The molecule is a trianionic form of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-gamma-glutamyl-L-lysine having anionic carboxylic acid and diphosphate groups and a protonated primary amino group (at the side-chain of the lysine residue; major species at pH7.3. It is a nucleotide-sugar oxoanion and a dicarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of an UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-gamma-glutamyl-L-lysine.
