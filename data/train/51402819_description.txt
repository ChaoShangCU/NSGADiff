The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that is quercetin attached to a beta-D-fucopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-D-fucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a tetrahydroxyflavone and a quercetin O-glycoside. It derives from a beta-D-fucose.
