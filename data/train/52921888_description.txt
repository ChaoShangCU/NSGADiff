The molecule is an icosanoid that is (5Z,9E,11Z,13E)-icosatetraenoic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at positions 8 and 15 (the 8S,15S-stereoisomer). It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from an arachidonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an 8(S),15(S)-DiHPETE(1-).
