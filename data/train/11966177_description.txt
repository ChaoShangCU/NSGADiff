The molecule is a long-chain (3S)-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a myristoyl-CoA and a (S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-CoA(4-).
