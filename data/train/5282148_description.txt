The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is biochanin A 7-O-beta-D-glucoside in which the hydroxy group at position 6 of the glucosyl moiety has been acylated by one of the carboxy groups of malonic acid. It is a member of 4'-methoxyisoflavones, a glycosyloxyisoflavone and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a biochanin A. It is a conjugate acid of a biochanin A 7-O-beta-D-glucoside 6''-O-malonate.
