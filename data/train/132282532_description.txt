The molecule is a docosanoid that is (9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying an epoxy group across positions 7 and 8 as well as a hydroxy substituent at position 17. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is an epoxy fatty acid, a docosanoid, a long-chain fatty acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 7,8-epoxy,17-hydroxy-(9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosapentaenoate.
