The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation between the carboxy group of phenylacetic acid and the secodary amino group of (5R,7S,8S)-N-methyl-7-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]decan-8-amine. It has a role as a kappa-opioid receptor agonist, an anti-inflammatory agent and a diuretic. It is an oxaspiro compound, a N-alkylpyrrolidine, an organic heterobicyclic compound and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
