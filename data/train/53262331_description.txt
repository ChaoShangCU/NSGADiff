The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion obtained by removal of a total of three protons from the carboxy and phosphate groups of 2-O-[alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-O-phospho-D-glyceric acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is an organophosphate oxoanion, a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and a monocarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a 2-O-[alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-O-phospho-D-glyceric acid.
