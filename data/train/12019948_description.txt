The molecule is an ergostanoid that is (22E)-ergosta-7,22-diene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 7 and an epoxy group across positions 5 and 6 (the 3beta,5alpha,6alpha,7alpha stereoisomer). It has been isolated from Aspergillus ochraceus as well as Penicillium commune. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite and a Penicillium metabolite. It is a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, an ergostanoid, a 7alpha-hydroxy steroid and an epoxy steroid.
