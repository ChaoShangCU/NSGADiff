The molecule is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid that is beta-D-glucuronic acid in which the anomeric hydroxyl hydrogen has been replaced by a 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepin-4-yl group. It is the glucuronidated conjugate of the midazolam metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam. It has a role as a drug metabolite, a human urinary metabolite and a human blood serum metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, a monosaccharide derivative, an imidazobenzodiazepine, a member of monofluorobenzenes and an organochlorine compound. It derives from a 1-hydroxymidazolam.
