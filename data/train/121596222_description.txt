The molecule is a class II yanuthone that is yanuthone X2 in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the 5,6-epoxycyclohex-2-en-1-one core has been converted to the corresponding acetate ester. Like yanuthone X2, yanuthone X1 has been isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger, but shows much lower antifungal activity towards the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans than yanuthone X2 (IC50 >100 muM for yanuthone X1, compared with = 51.7 +-4.7 muM for yanuthone X2). It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a class II yanuthone, an enol ether and an acetate ester. It derives from a yanuthone X2.
