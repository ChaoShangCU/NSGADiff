The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion resulting from the removal of a total of three protons from the phosphate and carboxy groups of 1-(2-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is an organophosphate oxoanion and a monocarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a 1-(2-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate.
