The molecule is a heparan sulfate composed of a backbone of repeating alpha-L-iduronosyl-(1->4)-N-sulfonyl-alpha-D-glucosamine units joined by (1->4)-linkages. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a member of heparan sulfates and a member of iduronic acids. It derives from a L-idopyranuronic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a heparosan N-sulfate L-iduronate polyanion.
