The molecule is an oligosaccharide derivative consisting of two 4,6-O-[(1R)-1-carboxyethylidene]-beta-D-galactosyloxy monosaccharide units linked via a dithiodihexyl divalent group. One of a panel of synthetic oligosaccharide derivatives designed to reveal a critical role of the rare aminosugar 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4-dideoxy-D-fucose (2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-galactose; D-AAT) for serotype 1 immune recognition (PMID:29632881). It is an oligosaccharide derivative and an organic disulfide.
