The molecule is a quassinoid that is picras-3-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 1, 11, 12 and 15, oxo groups at positions 2 and 16 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy residue at position 21. It has been isolated from he ethanol extract of the stem of Brucea mollis. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a delta-lactone, an enone, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, a tetrol, a quassinoid, a terpene glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a hydride of a picrasane.
