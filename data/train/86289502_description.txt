The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of D-galactose at the reducing end with an alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)-[N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)]-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl moiety attached at the 3-position. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
