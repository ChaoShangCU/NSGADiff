The molecule is a member of the class of 1,3-dihydroimidazole-2-thiones that is 1,3-dihydro-2H-imidazole-2-thione in which one of the nitrogens is substituted by a 5,7-difluoro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl group while the carbon adjacent to it is substituted by an aminomethyl group (the S enantiomer). It is a potent and selective inhibitor of both bovine and human dopamine beta-hydroxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. It has a role as an EC 1.14.17.1 (dopamine beta-monooxygenase) inhibitor. It is a member of tetralins, an organofluorine compound, a primary amino compound and a member of 1,3-dihydroimidazole-2-thiones.
