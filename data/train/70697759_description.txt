The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is 3beta,16beta,28-trihydroxyolean-12-ene substituted by a beta-benzoyloxy group at position 22 and a 3-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl group at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Glochidion eriocarpum, it exhibits cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a disaccharide derivative, a benzoate ester, a diol, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
