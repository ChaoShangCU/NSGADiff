The molecule is a homodetic cyclic peptide containing L-Pro, D-Tyr, L-Ser, L-Asn and L-Gln as the amino acid residues. Isolated from an endophytic fungus, Epichloe typhina, it exhibits inhibitory activity toward the spore germination of Cladosporium phlei, a pathogenic fungus of the timothy plant. It has a role as an antifungal agent and a fungal metabolite. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide and a macrocycle.
