The molecule is a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of pivalic acid. It has a role as a rat metabolite and a xenobiotic metabolite. It is a short-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a pivalic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a pivaloyl-CoA(4-).
