The molecule is an S-acyl-4'-phosphopantetheine obtained by formal condensation of the thiol group of D-pantetheine 4'-phosphate with the carboxy group of 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from a 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a S-(3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oyl)-4'-phosphopantetheine(2-).
