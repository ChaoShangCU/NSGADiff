The molecule is a lignan that consists of (+)-lyoniresinol attached to two beta-D-glucopyranosyl units at positions 4 and 4' via glycosidic linkages. Isolated from Indigofera heterantha, it exhibits inhibitory activity against lipoxygenase. It has a role as a metabolite and a lipoxygenase inhibitor. It is a lignan, a beta-D-glucoside, a dimethoxybenzene, a primary alcohol and a member of tetralins. It derives from a (+)-lyoniresinol.
