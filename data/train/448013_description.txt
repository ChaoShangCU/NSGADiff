The molecule is an epithilone that is epithilone D in which the double bond in the macrocyclic ring has been oxidised to the corresponding epoxide (the S,S stereoisomer). It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-stabilising agent. It is an epothilone and an epoxide.
