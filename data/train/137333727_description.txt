The molecule is a sesterterpenoid that is 4-oxocyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carboxylic acid carrying three additional methyl substituents at positions 2, 3 and 5 as well as farnsyl and hydroxy substituents at positions 3 and 6 respectively. An intermediate in the biosynthesis of terretonin. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a sesterterpenoid, a cyclic terpene ketone, an enol, an enone, a 3-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a 5-oxo monocarboxylic acid and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R)-farnesyl-2,3,5-trimethyl-6-oxido-4-oxocyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carboxylate.
