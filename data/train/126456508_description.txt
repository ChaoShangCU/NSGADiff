The molecule is a ketoaldonic acid that is butyric acid carrying an oxo substituent at position 3 as well as two hydroxy substituents at positions 2 and 4 (the S-enantiomer). It is a ketoaldonic acid, a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a 3-oxo monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a butyric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-2,4-dihydroxy-3-oxobutanoate. It is an enantiomer of a (R)-2,4-dihydroxy-3-oxobutanoic acid.
