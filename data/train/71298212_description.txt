The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of a linear trisaccharide of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and (at the reducing end) N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (1->3) and (1->6), to the N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue of which is also linked (1->3) a further beta-D-galactose residue. It is an amino tetrasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
