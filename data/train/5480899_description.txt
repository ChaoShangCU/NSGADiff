The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is the 7-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl derivative of acacetin. It is isolated from the flowering heads of Chrysanthemum morifolium and has been found to possess potent anti-HIV activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an anti-HIV agent. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a monohydroxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone and a beta-D-galactoside. It derives from a 5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone.
