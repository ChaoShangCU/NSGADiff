The molecule is the amide resulting from formal condensation of 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid with cis-1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-3-methoxypiperidin-4-amine. It has been used (as its monohydrate or as its tartrate) for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and for non-ulcer dyspepsia, but its propensity to cause cardiac arrhythmias resulted in its complete withdrawal from many countries, including the U.K., and restrictions on its use elsewhere. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist, an anti-ulcer drug and a gastrointestinal drug. It is a member of piperidines, a member of benzamides, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a substituted aniline, an organofluorine compound and an aromatic ether.
