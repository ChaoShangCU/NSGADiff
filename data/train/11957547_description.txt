The molecule is a hydrochloride salt obtained by reaction of (2R,3S)-EHNA with one equivalent of hydrochloric acid. Selective inhibitor of cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase (PDE2) (IC50 = 0.8 - 4 mM). Also a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. It has a role as an EC 3.1.4.* (phosphoric diester hydrolase) inhibitor and an EC 3.5.4.4 (adenosine deaminase) inhibitor. It contains a (2R,3S)-EHNA(1+).
