The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside that is coniferaldehyde in which the phenolic hydrogen has been replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as an Arabidopsis thaliana metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, an enal and a monomethoxybenzene. It derives from a coniferyl aldehyde.
