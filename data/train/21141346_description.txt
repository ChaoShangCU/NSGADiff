The molecule is a member of the class of pterocarpans that is 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan substituted with prenyl groups at positions 4 and 10 (the 6aR,11aR stereoisomer). Isolated from Erythrina stricta and Erythrina zeyheri, it exhibits antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities. It has a role as an antibacterial agent, an antineoplastic agent, an antiplasmodial drug and a plant metabolite. It is a member of pterocarpans and a member of phenols. It derives from a (6aR,11aR)-3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan.
