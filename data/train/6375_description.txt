The molecule is a primary nitroalkane that is methane in which one of the hydrogens is replace by a nitro group. A polar solvent (b.p. 101 â„ƒ), it is an important starting material in organic synthesis. It is also used as a fuel for rockets and radio-controlled models. It has a role as an EC 4.3.1.3 (histidine ammonia-lyase) inhibitor, a polar aprotic solvent and an explosive. It is a primary nitroalkane and a volatile organic compound.
