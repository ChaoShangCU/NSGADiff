The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is 24,25,26-trinoroleana-1(10),3,5,7-tetraen-29-oic acid bearing an oxo substituent at position 2, a hydroxy substituent at position 3 and two methyl groups at positions 9 and 13. An antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Potently inhibits lipid peroxidation in mitochondria and inhibits TNF-alpha-induced NFkappaB activation. Also shown to inhibit topoisomerase II activity in vitro (IC50 = 7.41 muM). It has a role as an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory drug, an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, a Hsp90 inhibitor and a metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a monocarboxylic acid.
