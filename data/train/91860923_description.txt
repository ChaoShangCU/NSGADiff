The molecule is a glycosyl alditol derivative consisting of two alpha-D-mannopyranose residues and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucitol joined in sequence by (1->2) and (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is a glycosyl alditol derivative, a glycoside and a member of acetamides. It derives from a N-acetyl-D-glucosaminitol.
