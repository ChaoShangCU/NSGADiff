The molecule is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside that is bhas#28 in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the ascarylopyranose moiety has been has been converted to the corresponding 1H-indole-3-carboxylate ester. It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside, a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid, a 4-O-(1H-indol-3-ylcarbonyl)ascaroside and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a bhas#28 and a (3R,15R)-3,15-dihydroxypalmitic acid.
