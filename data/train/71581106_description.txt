The molecule is a hydroxy fatty-acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 2-hydroxytetracosanoic acid. It is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a cerebronic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-hydroxytetracosanoyl-CoA(4-).
