The molecule is a hydroxydocosapentaenoic acid that consists of (8E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying a hydroxy substituent at position 7. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (8E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-7-hydroxydocosapentaenoate.
