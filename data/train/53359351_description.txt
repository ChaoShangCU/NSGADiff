The molecule is an isobenzofuranone that is thunberginol F attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group at position 4 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the roots of Scorzonera judaica. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a member of catechols, a monosaccharide derivative, a gamma-lactone and an isobenzofuranone. It derives from a thunberginol F.
