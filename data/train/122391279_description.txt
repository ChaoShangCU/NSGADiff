The molecule is a docosanoid that is (4Z,7Z,11Z,13Z,15E)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying two hydroperoxy substituents at positions 10 and 17. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid, a lipid hydroperoxide and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosa-4,7,10,13,16-pentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (4Z,7Z,11Z,13Z,15E,17S)-10,17-bis(hydroperoxy)docosapentaenoate.
