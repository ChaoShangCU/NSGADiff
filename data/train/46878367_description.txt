The molecule is the N-methylglucamine salt of amidotrizoic acid. Both the sodium and the meglumine salts of amidotrizoic acid have been widely used as water-soluble radioopaque media in diagnostic radiography. The use of a mixture of the two salts is often preferred, as adverse effects can be reduced. It has a role as a radioopaque medium. It contains an amidotrizoic acid anion and a N-methylglucamine.
