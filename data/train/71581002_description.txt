The molecule is a steroid saponin obtained from grain and leaves of oats (Avena sativa) that is nuatigenin in which the hydroxy group at position 26 is converted to its beta-D-glucoside and in which the hydroxy group at position 3 is converted into its methyl alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)]-beta-D-glucopyranoside derivative. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a tetrasaccharide derivative, a spiroketal, a steroid saponin and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a nuatigenin and an avenacoside A.
