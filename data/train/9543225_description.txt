The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxylic acid group of 3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is an oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, a branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a heptanoyl-CoA and a (3R)-3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoic acid.
