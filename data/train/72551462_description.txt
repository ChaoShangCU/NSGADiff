The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3R,13Z)-3-hydroxydocosenoic acid. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R,13Z)-3-hydroxydocosenoyl-CoA(4-).
