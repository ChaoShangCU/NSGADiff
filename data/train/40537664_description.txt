The molecule is a biaryl that is 2,2',3,3'-tetrahydro-4H,4'H-9,9'-bibenzo[g]chromene-4,4'-dione substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5, 5', 6, 6', 8 and 8' and methyl groups at positions 2, 2', 3 and 3' (the 2R,2'S,3R,3'R stereoisomer). It has been isolated from Chaetomium gracile. It has a role as a Chaetomium metabolite. It is a benzochromenone, a member of phenols and a biaryl.
