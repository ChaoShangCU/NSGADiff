The molecule is an extended flavonoid that is cyclomulberrin in which the hydroxy group at position 10 has undergone oxidative cyclisation to position 3 of the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl substituent, with migration of the double bond into conjugation with the aromatic ring. It is a moderate inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 = 16.2 - 36.6 muM), and a strong inhibitor of platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) induced platelet aggregation. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, a platelet aggregation inhibitor and an EC 1.14.18.1 (tyrosinase) inhibitor. It is an extended flavonoid, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a cyclic ketone and a polyphenol. It derives from a cyclomulberrin.
