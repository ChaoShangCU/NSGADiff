The molecule is an N-acetyl-beta-D-glycosaminyl glycopeptide consisting of an N-acetyl-beta-D-glycosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetylmuramoyl moiety attached to the amino terminus of the tripeptide L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-6-carboxy-L-lysine via an amide linkage. It is a conjugate acid of a N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-6-carboxy-L-lysine(2-).
