The molecule is a trihydroxyflavanone that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3, 5, 7 and 4' and prenyl groups at positions 6, 8 and 3'. Isolated from the roots of Lespedeza floribunda, it acts as a melanin synthesis inhibitor. It has a role as a metabolite and a melanin synthesis inhibitor. It is a member of dihydroflavonols, a tetrahydroxyflavanone, a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from a (2S)-flavanone.
