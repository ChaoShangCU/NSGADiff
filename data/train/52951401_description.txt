The molecule is a scalarane sesterterpenoid that is 12-epi-deoxoscalarin in which the acetoxy group at position 12 is replaced by a hydroxy group while the hydroxy group at position 19 is replaced by a methoxy group. It has been isolated from the sponge, Hyattella species. It has a role as an animal metabolite. It is a scalarane sesterterpenoid and an organic heteropentacyclic compound. It derives from a 12-epi-scalarin.
