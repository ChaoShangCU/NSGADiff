The molecule is an aromatic amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 8-methoxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)quinoline-5-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of 3,5-dichloropyridin-4-amine 1-oxide. It is a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase IV (PDE4). It has a role as a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor. It is a member of pyridine N-oxides, a chloropyridine, a monocarboxylic acid amide, a member of quinolines, an aromatic ether, an aromatic amide and an organofluorine compound.
