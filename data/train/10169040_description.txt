The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide consisting of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, beta-D-galactose and beta-D-glucose residues in a linear (1->3), (1->4), (1->4) sequence. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-D-Glcp.
