The molecule is a C-glycosyl compound that is isovitexin with the hydroxy group at position 7 replaced with a glucopyranosyl entity which in turn is substituted at position 6 by a feruloyl moiety. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a dihydroxyflavone, a C-glycosyl compound and a cinnamate ester. It derives from an isovitexin and a ferulic acid.
