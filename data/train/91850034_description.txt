The molecule is a mannotetraose that that is alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1->6)-D-mannopyranose joined in sequence by (1->3)-glycosidic bonds and in which the hydroxy group at position 3 of the D-mannopyranose group bat the reducing end has been glycosylated at position 3 by an alpha-D-mannopyranosyl group.
