The molecule is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (2E)-20-hydroxyicos-2-enoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from a (2E)-20-hydroxyicos-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an oscr#35(1-).
