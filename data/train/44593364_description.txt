The molecule is a hexacyclic triterpenoid that is D:A-friedooleanan-29-oic acid substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3 and an epoxy group across positions 3 and 24 (the (3beta,20alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from Salacia macrosperma and Tripterygium wilfordii, it exhibits anti-HIV activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a cyclic hemiketal. It derives from a hydride of a friedelane.
