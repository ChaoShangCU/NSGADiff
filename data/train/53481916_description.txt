The molecule is a 2-monoglyceride obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 14,15-EET with the 2-hydroxy group of glycerol. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite, a mitogen, a PPARalpha agonist and a human urinary metabolite. It is a 2-monoglyceride, an epoxide and a polyunsaturated fatty ester. It derives from a 14,15-EET.
