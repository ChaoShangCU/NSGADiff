The molecule is a disaccharide derivative that is 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone attached to a (3'-O-acetyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the roots of Rubia yunnanensis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a dihydroxyanthraquinone, a disaccharide derivative and an acetate ester. It derives from a 1,3,6-trihydroxy-2-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone.
