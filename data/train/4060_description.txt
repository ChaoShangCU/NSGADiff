The molecule is an imidazolidine-2,4-dione (hydantoin) in which the imidazolidine nucleus carries a methyl group at N-3 and has ethyl and phenyl substituents at C-5. An anticonvulsant, it is no longer available in the USA or the UK but is still studied largely because of its interesting hydroxylation polymorphism. It has a role as an anticonvulsant.
