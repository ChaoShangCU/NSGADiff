The molecule is a one-carbon compound that is methane in which the hydrogens have been replaced by two fluorines, a bromine, and a chlorine. Widely used in 'vapourising liquid'-type fire extinguishers, its use is now generally banned under the Montreal Protocol (ozone-depleting substances), although it is still used in certain applications (e.g. aviation). It is a one-carbon compound, an organobromine compound, an organochlorine compound and an organofluorine compound.
