The molecule is a homoflavonoid glycoside that is ophioglonol substituted by a prenyl group at position 5' as well as 2-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl and beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues at positions 7 and 4' respectively via glycosidic linkages. Isolated from the whole plants of Ophioglossum pedunculosum, it exhibits anti-HBV activity. It has a role as an anti-HBV agent and a plant metabolite. It is a homoflavonoid glycoside, a beta-D-glucoside and a hydroxy homoflavonoid. It derives from an ophioglonol.
