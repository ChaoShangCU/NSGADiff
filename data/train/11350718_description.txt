The molecule is a a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by the formal condensation of the amino group of 3-[(1S)-1-amino-3-methylbutyl]-8-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-isochromen-1-one with the carboxy group of 4-amino-2,3-dihydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid (the 2S,3S,4S stereoisomer). It is isolated from the culture broth of Bacillus sp.PhM-PHD-090 and exhibits potent antitumour activity. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an antineoplastic agent and a bacterial metabolite. It is a member of isocoumarins, a secondary alcohol, a member of phenols, a primary amino compound and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
