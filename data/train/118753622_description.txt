The molecule is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A in which the N-methylleucine residues at positions 6 and 9 have both undergone oxidation by hydroxylation at the carbon bearing the two methyl groups, and in which while the N-methylleucine residue at position 4 has undergone N-demethylation. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M16.
