The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of phosphate and diphosphate functions of lauroyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a lauroyl-CoA.
