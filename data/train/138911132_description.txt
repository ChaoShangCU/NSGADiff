The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is myricetin in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been converted to the corresponding O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside. Identified in PMID 29667287 Fig. S17, peak 8. It is a glycosyloxyflavone and a sophoroside. It derives from a myricetin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside. It is a conjugate acid of a myricetin 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside(1-).
