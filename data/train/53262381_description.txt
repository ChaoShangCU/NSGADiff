The molecule is an amino acid zwitterion that is the zwitterionic form of O-(3-O-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl)-L-serine arising from transfer of a proton from the carboxy to the amino group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a tautomer of an O-(3-O-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl)-L-serine.
