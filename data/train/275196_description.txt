The molecule is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid that is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline which is substituted by a 4,5-dimethoxy-3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2-benzofuran-1-yl group at position 1, a methylenedioxy group at positions 6-7 and a methoxy group at position 8. Obtained from plants of the Papaveraceae family, it lacks significant painkilling properties and is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects. It has a role as an antitussive, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and a plant metabolite. It is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, a tertiary amino compound, a cyclic acetal, an isobenzofuranone, an organic heterobicyclic compound, an organic heterotricyclic compound and an aromatic ether. It derives from a (-)-noscapine hemiacetal.
