The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->2) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp.
