The molecule is a labdane diterpenoid that is labdane with a double bond at position 13 and is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 8alpha and 19 and a carboxy group at position 15. Isolated from the aerial parts of Crassocephalum mannii, it exhibits inhibitory activity towards cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a labdane diterpenoid, a diol and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid.
