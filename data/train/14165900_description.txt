The molecule is a diterpene that has a dicyclopenta[a,d]cyclooctane skeleton containing a double bond at the 6a-7 position and which is substituted by methyl groups at positions 1 and 9a, a methylene group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7 (the 1R,3aR,9aS,10aR isomer). A precursor for sordaricin, the aglycone of sodarin found in Sordaria araneosa. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It is a diterpene, an organic tricyclic compound and an olefinic compound.
