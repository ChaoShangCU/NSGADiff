The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is 3,16,28-trihydroxyolean-12-en-22-yl (2Z)-2-methylbut-2-enoate attached to a tetrasaccharide residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the stems of Gordonia chrysandra, it exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a tetrasaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid. It derives from an angelic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
