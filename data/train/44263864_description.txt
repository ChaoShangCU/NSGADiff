The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide compound consisting of a GlcNAc residue at the reducing end with a Man-alpha(1->3)-[Man-alpha(1->6)]-Man-beta(1->4)-GlcNAc moiety attached via a beta-(1->4)-linkage and a Fuc residue attached via an alpha-(1->3)-linkage. It has a role as an allergen. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a high-mannose oligosaccharide.
