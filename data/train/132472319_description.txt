The molecule is a dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DiHDPE) that is (7Z,10Z,13E,14E,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at the 16 and 17-S positions. It is an intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a specialised pro-resolving mediator. It is a conjugate acid of a 16,17(S)-dihydroxy-(7Z,10Z,13E,14E,19Z)-docosapentaenoate.
