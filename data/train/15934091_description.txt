The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is genistin in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 6'' has been replaced by a malonyl group. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyisoflavone, a hydroxyisoflavone, a malonate ester, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a genistein 7-O-beta-D-glucoside.
