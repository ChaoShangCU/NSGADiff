The molecule is an indolyl carbohydrate that is cyclodopa in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 5 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as a mouse metabolite, a rat metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a member of phenols, an indolyl carbohydrate and an indolyl carboxylic acid. It derives from a leucodopachrome.
