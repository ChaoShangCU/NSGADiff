The molecule is an N(2)-acyl-L-glutamine resulting from the formal condensation of the alpha-amino group of L-glutamine with the carboxy group of (2E)-3-methylhex-2-enoic acid. It is a N(2)-acyl-L-glutamine, a primary carboxamide and a secondary carboxamide. It is a conjugate acid of a N(2)-[(2E)-3-methylhex-2-enoyl]-L-glutaminate.
