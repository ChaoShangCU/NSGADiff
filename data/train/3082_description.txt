The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide that is N-methylacetamide in which one of the hydrogens of the methyl group attached to the carbonyl moiety is replaced by a (dimethoxyphosphorothioyl)sulfanediyl group. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor, an agrochemical, an acaricide, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor, an insecticide, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is an organic thiophosphate and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It derives from a N-methyl-2-sulfanylacetamide.
