The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside resulting from the formal condensation the tertiary allylic hydroxy group of steviol with beta-D-glucopyranose. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monocarboxylic acid, a tetracyclic diterpenoid, a bridged compound, an ent-kaurane diterpenoid and a diterpene glycoside. It derives from a steviol. It is a conjugate acid of a steviolmonoside(1-).
