The molecule is a 1-(alk-1-enyl)-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine in which the alkyl and the acyl groups at positions 1 and 2 are specified as (1Z)-hexadecenyl and (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoyl respectively. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a tautomer of a 1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-2-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion.
