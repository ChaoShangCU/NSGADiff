The molecule is a docosanoid anion obtained by deprotonation of the three carboxy groups and protonation of the glutamyl alpha-amino group of 16(S)-glutathionyl,17(R)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,10,12,14,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is a docosanoid anion, a peptide anion and a tricarboxylic acid dianion. It is a conjugate base of a 16(S)-glutathionyl-17(R)-hydroxy-(4Z,7Z,10,12,14,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid.
