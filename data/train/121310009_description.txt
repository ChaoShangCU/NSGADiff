The molecule is a C-nucleoside phosphate that is GS-441524 in which the 5'-hydroxy group has been replaced by a phosphate group. In cells, GS-441524 monophosphate gets converted into the pharmacologically active triphosphate form (GS-443902). It has a role as an anticoronaviral agent, an antiviral drug and a drug metabolite. It is a C-nucleoside phosphate, an aromatic amine, a nitrile and a pyrrolotriazine. It derives from a GS-441524.
