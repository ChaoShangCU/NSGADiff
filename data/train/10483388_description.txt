The molecule is a lignan that is (+)-lyoniresinol substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the root barks of Stemmadenia minima and Lycium chinense, it exhibits antimicrobial activities. It has a role as a metabolite, an antibacterial agent and an antifungal agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a dimethoxybenzene, a lignan, a primary alcohol, a monosaccharide derivative, a polyphenol and a member of tetralins. It derives from a (+)-lyoniresinol.
