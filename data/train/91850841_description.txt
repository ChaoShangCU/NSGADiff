The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of two beta-D-galactopyranose residues and a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose residue joined in sequence by (1->6) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->6)-D-GlcNAcp and a beta-(1->6)-galactobiose.
