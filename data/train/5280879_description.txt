The molecule is a leukotriene that is (7E,9E,11Z,14Z)-icosa-7,9,11,14-tetraenoic acid substituted by a hydroxy group at position 5 (5S) and an L-cystein-S-yl group at position 6 (6R). It is a leukotriene, an amino dicarboxylic acid, a secondary alcohol, a L-cysteine thioether and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from an icosa-7,9,11,14-tetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a leukotriene E4(1-).
