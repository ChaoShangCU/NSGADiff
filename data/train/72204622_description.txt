The molecule is a member of the class of resolvins that is (4Z,8E,10Z,12E,14E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying three hydroxy substituents at positions 7, 16 and 17 (the 7S,16R,17R-stereoisomer). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a resolvin, a triol, a secondary allylic alcohol and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid.
