The molecule is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxydodecanoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a lauroyl-CoA and a (S)-3-hydroxylauric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxylauroyl-CoA(4-).
