The molecule is a carbocyclic fatty acid that is octanoic (caprylic) acid substituted at position 8 by a 3-oxo-2-{(Z)-pent-2-en-1-yl}cyclopentyl group (the 1R,2R-diastereomer). It is a carbocyclic fatty acid, an oxo fatty acid and a monounsaturated fatty acid. It derives from an octanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an 8-[(1R,2R)-3-oxo-2-{(Z)-pent-2-en-1-yl}cyclopentyl]octanoate.
