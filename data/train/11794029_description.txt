The molecule is a naphthochromene that is 4H-naphtho[2,3-h]chromene which is substituted at position 2 by a (2R)-butan-2-yl group, at position 5 by a hydroxymethyl group, at position 11 by a hydroxy group, and at positions 4, 7, and 12 by oxogroups. An antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces sp. cu39, it exerts a potent protecting effect on neuronal cells through suppressing L-glutamate toxicity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antimicrobial agent. It is a member of phenols, a member of benzyl alcohols, a naphthochromene and a member of p-quinones.
