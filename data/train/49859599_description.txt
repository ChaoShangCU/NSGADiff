The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (5Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosatetraenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and an (11Z)-Delta(11)-fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (5Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosatetraenoyl-CoA.
