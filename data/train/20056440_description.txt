The molecule is an N-sulfonylurea in which the sulfur atom is attached to a 4-carboxy-2-methylthiophen-3-yl group and in which the non-sulfonated nitrogen is substituted by a 3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl group. It is a metabolite of the herbicide, thiencarbazone-methyl. It has a role as a herbicide, an agrochemical, an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor and a metabolite. It is a thiophenecarboxylic acid, a N-sulfonylurea, an ether and a member of triazoles.
