The molecule is a member of the class of nectriapyrones that is pyran-2-one which is substituted at positions 3, 4, and 6 by methyl, methoxy, and but-2-en-2-yl groups, respectively in which the butenyl substituent has E configuration. A fungal metabolite that has been induced in the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae by overexpression of a polyketide synthase gene (NEC1) and an O-methyltransferase gene (NEC2). It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It derives from a desmethylnectriapyrone.
