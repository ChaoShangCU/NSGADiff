The molecule is a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of tetracosanoic (lignoceric) acid. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It derives from a coenzyme A and a tetracosanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a tetracosanoyl-CoA(4-).
