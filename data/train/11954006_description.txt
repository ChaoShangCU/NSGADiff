The molecule is a trihydroxyflavone that is kaempferol substituted at position 3 by a 6-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl moiety via a glycosidic linkage. It is a member of flavonol 3-O-[6-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside]s, a trihydroxyflavone and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a kaempferol and a trans-4-coumaric acid.
