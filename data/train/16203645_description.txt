The molecule is a steroid saponin that consists of (1beta,3beta,5beta,25S)-spirostan-1,3,17-triol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1->3)]-6-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 1 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the rhizomes of Convallaria majalis and exhibits significant cytotoxicity against human submandibular gland carcinoma (HSG) cells. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a trisaccharide derivative, a 3beta-hydroxy steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid and a steroid saponin. It derives from a hydride of a (25S)-5beta-spirostan.
