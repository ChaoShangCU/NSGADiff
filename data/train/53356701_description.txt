The molecule is a branched amino octasaccharide consisting of a beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-D-glucose moiety with the galactosyl residue having an alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->3)-[beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl group attached at the 3-position and an alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->3)-[beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl group at the 6-position. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an amino octasaccharide.
