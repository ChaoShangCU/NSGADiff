The molecule is a member of the class of benzoic acids that is 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-[(2-sulfophenyl)methyl]benzoic acid in which both of the benzylic hydrogens are replaced by a 3-carboxy-5-methyl-4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene group. The trisodium salt is the biological stain 'chromoxane cyanin R'. It has a role as a histological dye. It is a monohydroxybenzoic acid, an arenesulfonic acid and a member of quinomethanes. It is a conjugate acid of a chromoxane cyanin R(3-).
