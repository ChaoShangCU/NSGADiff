The molecule is a member of the class of N-acetylneuraminic acids that is N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-alpha-neuraminic acid in which the hydroxy group at position 2 (adjacent to the carboxy group) has been methylated to give the corresponding methoxy group. It is a member of N-acetylneuraminic acids, a cyclic acetal and an acetate ester. It derives from a N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-alpha-neuraminic acid.
