The molecule is a quadruply-charged organophosphate oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and sufate groups of 3'-phosphonato-5'-adenylyl sulfate; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a human metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is an organophosphate oxoanion and an organosulfate oxoanion. It is a conjugate base of a 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate.
