The molecule is a 3-sn-phosphatidyl L-serine in which the phosphatidyl acyl groups at positions 1 and 2 are stearoyl and (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoyl respectively. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from an octadecanoic acid and a linoleic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine(1-).
