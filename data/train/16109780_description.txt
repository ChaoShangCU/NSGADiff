The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is composed of (3beta,16alpha)-13,28-epoxyoleanane-3,16-diol having a alpha-L-Rhap-(1->2)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Arap moiety attached at position 3 by a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the whole plants of Ardisia japonica and exhibits significant cytotoxicity against a panel of human cancer cell lines. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a trisaccharide derivative, a bridged compound, a cyclic ether, a secondary alcohol, a hexacyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a (3beta,16alpha)-13,28-epoxyoleanane-3,16-diol. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
