The molecule is an aminotetrasaccharide consisting of three molecules of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose joined in sequence by (1->3) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds in which the non-terminal group has been glycosylated at the 6-hydroxy group by fourth 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose moiety. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides.
