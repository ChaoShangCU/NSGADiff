The molecule is an L-alpha-amino acid zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the carboxy to the amino group of anticapsin; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as an EC 2.6.1.16 (glutamine--fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (isomerizing)) inhibitor, an antimicrobial agent, a bacterial metabolite and an antimetabolite. It is a tautomer of an anticapsin.
