The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide comprised of an L-alpha-fucosyl residue linked (1->3) to the GlcNAc residue of alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
