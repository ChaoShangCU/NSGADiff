The molecule is a nucleoside triphosphate analogue that is 5'-O-[({[dichloro(phosphono)methyl](hydroxy)phosphoryl}oxy)(hydroxy)phosphoryl]adenosine carrying additional 2-(methylsulfanyl)ethyl and (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)sulfanyl substituents at positions N6 and C2 respectively. Used (in the form of its tetrasodium salt) as an intravenous antiplatelet drug that prevents formation of harmful blood clots in the coronary arteries. It has a role as a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. It is a member of adenosines, a nucleoside triphosphate analogue, an organofluorine compound, an aryl sulfide, an organochlorine compound and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate acid of a cangrelor(4-).
