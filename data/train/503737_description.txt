The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is liquiritigenin attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 4' via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an anticoronaviral agent and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a flavanone glycoside, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a monohydroxyflavanone. It derives from a liquiritigenin.
