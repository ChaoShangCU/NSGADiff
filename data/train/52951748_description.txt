The molecule is a homoflavonoid glycoside that is ophioglonol attached to beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues at positions 7 and 4' respectively via glycosidic linkages. It has been isolated from the whole plants of Ophioglossum pedunculosum. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a homoflavonoid glycoside and a hydroxy homoflavonoid. It derives from an ophioglonol.
