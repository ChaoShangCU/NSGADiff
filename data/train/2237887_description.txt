The molecule is a member of the class of benzamides obtained by the formal condensation of 2-(aminomethyl)-3,4,6-trichlorophenol and benzoic acid. The carboxamide is further esterified at the phenolic hydroxy group by 4-nitrobenzoic acid. It is a C-nitro compound, a benzoate ester, a member of benzamides and a trichlorobenzene. It derives from a 4-nitrobenzoic acid, a 2-(aminomethyl)-3,4,6-trichlorophenol and a benzoic acid.
