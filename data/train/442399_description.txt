The molecule is a cyclic ketone derived from spiro[4.5]dec-6-en-8-one by substitution of hydrogens by methyl groups at positions 6 and 10, and by an isopropenyl group at position 2 (the (2R,5S,10R)-diastereoisomer). It has a role as a phytoalexin and a plant metabolite. It is a spiro compound, a sesquiterpenoid and a cyclic ketone.
