The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is (+)-alpha-santalene in which one of the methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond has been oxidised to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. It has a role as an insecticide and a plant metabolite. It is a bridged compound, a sesquiterpenoid and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a hydride of a (+)-alpha-santalene.
