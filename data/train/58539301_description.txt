The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-{[5-chloro-4-(methylamino)pyrimidin-2-yl]amino}-3-methoxybenzoic acid with the amino group of morpholine. It is an inhibitor of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.1 (non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor. It is an aminopyrimidine, a member of morpholines, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an organochlorine compound, a secondary amino compound and an aromatic ether.
