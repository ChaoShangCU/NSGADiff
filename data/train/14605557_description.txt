The molecule is a C19-gibberellin, initially identified in Malus sylvestris. It differs from gibberellin A1 in the absence of an OH group at C-7 and the presence of a double bond between C-3 and C-4 (all gibbane numbering). It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a C19-gibberellin, a gibberellin monocarboxylic acid and a lactone.
