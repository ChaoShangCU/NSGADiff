The molecule is a linear amino tetrasaccharide comprising an N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine residue,two L-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose residues and a 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (2-keto-3-deoxy-D-mannooctanoic acid, Kdo) in a (1->2), (1->3), (1->5) sequence. Corresponds to the icsb and lpt3 mutant of the core oligosaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis.
