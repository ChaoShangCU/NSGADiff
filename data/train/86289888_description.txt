The molecule is a 4-O-(1H-indol-3-ylcarbonyl)ascaroside that is icas#16 in which the pro-R hydrogen beta to the carboxy group is replaced by a hydroxy group. It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside, a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid, a 4-O-(1H-indol-3-ylcarbonyl)ascaroside and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from an icas#16, a bhas#16 and a (3R,9R)-3,9-dihydroxydecanoic acid.
