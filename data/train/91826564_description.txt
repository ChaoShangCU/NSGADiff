The molecule is a (2R)-2-methylacyl-CoA(4-) oxanion arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (2R)-2-methyltetradecanoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3 It is a (2R)-2-methylacyl-CoA(4-) and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (2R)-2-methyltetradecanoyl-CoA.
