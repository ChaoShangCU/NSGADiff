The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine obtained by formal condensation of one of the carboxy groups of azelaic acid with the 1-hydroxy group of sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It derives from a nonanedioic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(1-).
