The molecule is an amino trisaccharide comprised of an 6-sulfated beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue, a 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue, and a 2-acetamido-D-galactopyranosyl reidue joined in sequence by (1->4) and (1->3) glycosidic linkages. It is an oligosaccharide sulfate and an amino trisaccharide.
