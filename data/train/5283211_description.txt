The molecule is a hepoxilin having (5Z,9E,14Z) double bond stereochemistry, an 8-hydroxy substituent and an 11S,12S-epoxy group. It has a role as a rat metabolite and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a hepoxilin, an epoxy fatty acid, a long-chain fatty acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It derives from a (5Z,9E,14Z)-icosa-5,9,14-trienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a hepoxilin A3(1-).
