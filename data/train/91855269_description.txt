The molecule is a branched trisaccharide that is alpha-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3 have been converted to the corresponding alpha-L-fucopyranosyl and alpha-D-galactopyranosyl derivatives, respectively. It derives from an alpha-(1->3)-galactobiose and an alpha-L-fucose.
