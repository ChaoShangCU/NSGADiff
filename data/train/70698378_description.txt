The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide consisting of a linear sequence of alpha-neuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues linked (2->3) and (1->6), to the N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue of which is also linked (2->6) another alpha-neuraminyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
