The molecule is an enamide obtained by the formal condensation of 2-methylpropanamine with tetradeca-2,4,8,10,12-pentaenoic acid (the 2E,4E,8Z,10E,12E stereoisomer). Isolated from Zanthoxylum piperitum, it exhibits inhibitory activity against acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. It has a role as an EC 2.3.1.26 (sterol O-acyltransferase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is an enamide and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a 2-methylpropanamine.
