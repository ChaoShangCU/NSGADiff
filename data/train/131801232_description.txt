The molecule is a polyanionic polymer obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate groups of 4-O-[poly(2-beta-D-glucosyl-1-D-ribitylphosphonato)-1-D-ribitylphosphonato-(2R)-1-glycerylphosphonato]-N-acetyl-beta-D-mannosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl ditrans,octacis-undecaprenyl diphosphate; major species at pH 7.3. It is a polyanionic polymer and an organophosphate oxoanion.
