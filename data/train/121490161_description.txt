The molecule is a camphorsulfonate salt obtained by reaction of rucaparib with one molar equivalent of (1S,4R)-camphorsulfonic acid. It is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and is used as monotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer and deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutation. It has a role as an EC 2.4.2.30 (NAD(+) ADP-ribosyltransferase) inhibitor. It is a camphorsulfonate salt and an azepinoindole. It contains a (S)-camphorsulfonate and a rucaparib(1+).
