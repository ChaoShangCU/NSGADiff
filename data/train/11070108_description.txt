The molecule is a hydroxyisoflavanone that is dihydrogenistein in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 7 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a hydroxyisoflavanone and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a dihydrogenistein.
