The molecule is a hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid, obtained by the formal substitution of a hydrogen at position 11 of (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid by a hydroperoxy group (the 11S-stereoisomer). It derives from an alpha-linolenic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,11S,12Z,15Z)-11-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoate.
