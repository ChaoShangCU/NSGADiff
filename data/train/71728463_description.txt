The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acid anion that is the conjugate base of (8E,10S,12Z)-10-hydroperoxyoctadeca-8,12-dienoic acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group. It is a hydroperoxy fatty acid anion, a long-chain fatty acid anion, a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion and a hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acid anion. It is a conjugate base of an (8E,10S,12Z)-10-hydroperoxyoctadeca-8,12-dienoic acid. It is an enantiomer of an (8E,10R,12Z)-10-hydroperoxy-8,12-octadecadienoate.
