The molecule is a linear tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of beta-D-galactose, alpha-D-galactose, beta-L-rhamnose and beta-D-glucose residues linked sequentially (1->2), (1->3) and (1->4), with the glucose residue linked glycosidically to a 5-aminopentyl group. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
