The molecule is an amino disaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been converted into the corresponding alpha-D-galactopyranoside. It is an amino disaccharide, a member of acetamides and an alpha-D-galactoside. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and an alpha-D-galactose.
