The molecule is a form of tetrahydrofolate that acts as a donor of formyl groups in anabolism. In these reactions 10-formyltetrahydrofolic acid is used as a substrate in formyltransferase reactions, which is important in purine biosynthesis. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a 10-formyltetrahydrofolate(2-).
