The molecule is a monohydroxybenzoic acid that is 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in which the phenolic hydrogen at position 2 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucosyl residue. It has a role as an Arabidopsis thaliana metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside and a monohydroxybenzoic acid. It derives from a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid.
