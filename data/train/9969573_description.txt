The molecule is an azaspiro compound that is methoxycyclohexane which is fused at position 4 to the 5-position of a 1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one that is substituted at positions 3 and 4 by 2,5-dimethylphenyl and (ethoxycarbonyl)oxy groups, respectively (the cis isomer). It is a proinsecticide (via hydrolysis of the ethyl carbonate group to give the corresponding 4-hydroxypyrrol-2-one, "spirotetramat-enol") and is used for the control of a wide range of sucking insects on fruit and potato crops. It has a role as a proinsecticide, an EC 6.4.1.2 (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) inhibitor and an agrochemical. It is a member of benzenes, an azaspiro compound, a carbonate ester, a gamma-lactam and a member of pyrroles.
