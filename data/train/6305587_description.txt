The molecule is a tertiary amino compound that consists of 2-amino-7-hydroxytetralin in which the two amino hydrogens are substituted by 2E)-3-iodoallyl and propyl groups. This ligand has uniquely high affinity and selectivity for the D3 receptor. It has a role as a dopamine agonist. It is a tertiary amino compound, a member of tetralins, an organoiodine compound and a member of phenols. It is a conjugate base of a 2-{[(2E)-3-iodoprop-2-en-1-yl](propyl)ammonio}tetralin-7-ol(1+). It derives from a hydride of a tetralin.
