The molecule is the 1-[(isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy]ethyl (proxetil) ester prodrug of cefpodoxime. After swallowing, hydrolysis of the ester group occurs in the intestinal epithelium, to release active cefpodoxime in the bloodstream. It is used to treat acute otitis media, pharyngitis, and sinusitis. It has a role as a prodrug and an antibacterial drug. It is a carboxylic ester, a cephalosporin and a carboxylic acid. It derives from a cefpodoxime and a 4-{((R)-2-Carboxy-3-methoxymethyl-8-oxo-5-thia-1-aza-bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7-ylcarbamoyl)-[(Z)-methoxyimino]-methyl}-thiazol-2-yl-ammonium.
