The molecule is a diterpene glycoside that is isopimar-7-en-19-oic acid attached to a alpha-D-mannopyranosyloxy residue at position 16. It has been isolated from the fungus, Xylaria species. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It is a diterpenoid, a monosaccharide derivative, a monocarboxylic acid and a diterpene glycoside. It derives from an alpha-D-mannose. It derives from a hydride of an isopimarane.
