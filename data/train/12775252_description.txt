The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 6 have been converted into the corresponding 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl and alpha-L-fucopyranosyl derivatives, respectively. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine.
