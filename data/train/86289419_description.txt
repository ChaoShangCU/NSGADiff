The molecule is a phenolate anion obtained by deprotonation of the 5- and 7-hydroxy groups of cyanidin 3-O-[6-O-(6-O-4-hydroxycinnamoyl-beta-D-glucosyl)-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside]. It is the major microspecies at pH 7.3 (according to Marvin v 6.2.0.). It is a conjugate base of a cyanidin 3-O-{6-O-[6-O-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl]-2-O-beta-D-xylosyl-beta-D-galactoside}.
