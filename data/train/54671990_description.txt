The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is the monosaccharide derivative of (3beta,6beta)-3,6,23-trihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oic acid. It has been isolated from the stem bark of Kalopanax pictus. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a carboxylic ester and a triol. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
