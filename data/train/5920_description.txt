The molecule is an iodothyronine compound having iodo substituents at the 3-, 3'- and 5-positions. Although some is produced in the thyroid, most of the 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine in the body is generated by mono-deiodination of L-thyroxine in the peripheral tissues. Its metabolic activity is about 3 to 5 times that of L-thyroxine. The sodium salt is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. It has a role as a thyroid hormone, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an iodophenol, a 2-halophenol and an iodothyronine. It is a conjugate acid of a 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyroninate. It is a tautomer of a 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine zwitterion.
