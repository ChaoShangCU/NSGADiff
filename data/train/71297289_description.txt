The molecule is a branched amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 6 have each been glycosylated by a alpha-L-fucopyranosyl group. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-D-GlcpNAc and an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->6)-D-GlcpNAc.
