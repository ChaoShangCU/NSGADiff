The molecule is a monoterpene glycoside that is geraniol-5,10-olide glycosylated at position 1 by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl group. Isolated from the aerial parts of Sibiraea angustata, it exhibits anti-obesity activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an anti-obesity agent. It is a monoterpene glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a gamma-lactone, a terpene lactone and a beta-D-glucoside.
