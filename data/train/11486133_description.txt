The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2E)-(methoxyimino){2-[(3E,5E,6E)-5-(methoxyimino)-4,6-dimethyl-2,8-dioxa-3,7-diazanona-3,6-dien-1-yl]phenyl}acetic acid with the amino group of methylamine. A rice fungicide that is highly effective against Magnaporthe oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae, Thanatephorus cucumeris and Rhizoctonia solani. It has a role as a mitochondrial cytochrome-bc1 complex inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is an oxime O-ether, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an amide fungicide and a methoxyiminoacetamide strobilurin antifungal agent.
