The molecule is a thienothiazine-derived monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 6-chloro-4-hydroxy-2-methylthieno[2,3-e][1,2]thiazine-3-carboxylic acid 1,1-dioxide with the amino group of 2-aminopyridine. Used for the treatment of pain, primarily resulting from inflammatory diseases of the joints, osteoarthritis, surgery, sciatica and other inflammations. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic and an antipyretic. It is a thienothiazine, a member of pyridines, a monocarboxylic acid amide, an organochlorine compound and a heteroaryl hydroxy compound.
