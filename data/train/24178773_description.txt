The molecule is a scalarane sesterterpenoid that is 12-epi-scalarin in which the hydorxy group at position 19 is replaced by a methoxy group. It has been isolated from the sponge, Hyattella species. It has a role as an animal metabolite. It is a scalarane sesterterpenoid, an acetate ester, an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a gamma-lactone. It derives from a 12-epi-scalarin.
