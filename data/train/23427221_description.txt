The molecule is an alkaloid ester obtained by formal condensation of cystodytin D with elaidic acid. It is isolated from the Okinawan marine tunicate Cystodytes dellechiajei and exhibits cytotoxicity against human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an enamide, an enone, an organic heterotetracyclic compound, an alkaloid ester and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a 3-methylbut-2-enoic acid, an elaidic acid and a cystodytin D.
