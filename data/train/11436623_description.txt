The molecule is a benzoate ester obtained by the formal condensation of o-orsellinic acid with (3E)-1-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one. Isolated from Chaetomium globosum, it exhibits cytotoxic activity towards cancer cell lines. It has a role as a Chaetomium metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a benzoate ester and a member of resorcinols. It derives from an o-orsellinic acid.
