The molecule is the monosodium salt of ertapenem. It is used for the treatment of moderate to severe susceptible infections including intra-abdominal and acute gynaecological infections, pneumonia, and infections of the skin and of the urinary tract. It is more stable to renal dehydropeptidase I tham imipenem, and so unlike imipenem, its use with cilastatin, which inhibits the enzyme, is not required. It has a role as an antibacterial drug. It contains an ertapenem(1-).
