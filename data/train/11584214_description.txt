The molecule is an organic heterotetracyclic compound resulting from cyclocondensation of the 4- and 5-hydroxy groups of (2S,4S)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6,8-dimethylchromane-4,5,7-triol across the 1- and 2-positions of 3-O-acetyl-1,2-didehydro-D-glucose. A natural product found in Abacopteris penangiana. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a carbohydrate derivative, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a polycyclic ether. It derives from a beta-D-glucose.
