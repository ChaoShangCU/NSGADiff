The molecule is a synthetic pentasaccharide which, apart from the O-methyl group at the reducing end of the molecule, consists of monomeric sugar units which are identical to a sequence of five monomeric sugar units that can be isolated after either chemical or enzymatic cleavage of the polymeric glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate. It has a role as an anticoagulant. It is an amino sugar, an oligosaccharide sulfate and a pentasaccharide derivative. It derives from a normethylfondaparinux. It is a conjugate acid of a fondaparinux(10-).
