The molecule is a biflavonoid that is obtained by oxidative coupling of two molecules of apigenin resulting in a bond between positions C-3 of the hydroxyphenyl ring and C-6 of the chromene ring. Isolated from Thuja orientalis and Rhus succedanea it exhibits antioxidant, cytotoxic and anti-hepatitis B activity. It has a role as an antioxidant, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-HBV agent and a metabolite. It is a biflavonoid, a hydroxyflavone and a ring assembly.
