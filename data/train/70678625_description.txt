The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is composed of primulagenin A having a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl moiety attached to position 3 by a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the whole plants of Ardisia pusilla and exhibits cytotoxic activity against human gliboblastoma U251MG cells. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a primulagenin A.
