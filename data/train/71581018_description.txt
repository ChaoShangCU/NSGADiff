The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (9Z,12Z)-3-oxolinoleic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,12Z)-3-oxolinoleoyl-CoA(4-).
