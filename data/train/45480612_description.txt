The molecule is a linear tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of beta-D-glucose, N-acetyl-alpha-D-fucosamine, N-acetyl-alpha-L-quinovosamine and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues linked sequentially (1->6), (1->3) and (1->3). It forms an important epitope of the Proteus vulgaris O-specific polysaccharide. It has a role as an epitope.
