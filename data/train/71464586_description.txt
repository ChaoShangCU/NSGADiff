The molecule is an organoammonium salt obtained by reaction of gadoteric acid with one equivalent of 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-D-glucitol (meglumine). It is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial), spine and associated tissues of patients ages 2 years and older, to detect and visualise areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier and/or abnormal vascularity of the central nervous system. It has a role as a MRI contrast agent. It is an organoammonium salt and a gadolinium coordination entity. It contains a gadoterate.
