The molecule is a binaphthopyran resulting from the formal oxidative dimerisation at position 6 of two molecules of methyl (9,10-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1-oxo-3,4-dihydro-1H-naphtho[2,3-c]pyran-3-yl)acetate. It is a binaphthopyran, a methyl ester, a polyketide, a ring assembly, an aromatic ether and a member of phenols.
