The molecule is a hexasaccharide derivative consisting of an alpha-D-mannosyl residue beta-linked to a 5-aminopentyl group and which carries at O-3 an beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-alpha-D-glucosyl-(1->4)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl branched pentasaccharide unit.
