The molecule is a member of the class of benzamides obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4'-(trifluoromethyl)biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of 9-[4-(4-aminopiperidin-1-yl)butyl]-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-9H-fluorene-9-carboxamide. Used (as its mesylate salt) as a complement to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. It has a role as an anticholesteremic drug and a MTP inhibitor. It is a member of piperidines, a member of fluorenes, a member of benzamides and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes. It is a conjugate base of a lomitapide(1+).
