The molecule is a heteroglycan consisting of beta-(1->4)-linked D-glucose (G) and D-mannose (M) in a proportion of 5:8. The basic polymeric repeating unit has the pattern: GGMMGMMMMMGGM, with branching through beta-(1->3)- and beta-(1->6)-glucosyl linkages. Acetate groups are present on C-6 every 9-19 units of the main chain. It has a role as a nutraceutical.
