The molecule is a 19-membered cyclodepsipeptide consisting of a 3-hydroxy-4-methyldecanoyl moiety linked to the peptide sequence of 5 amino acids. Isolated from the fermentation broth of marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola, it has been found to block tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of NFkappaB-Luc human embryonic kidney cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cyclodepsipeptide and a macrocycle. It derives from a (3S,4S)-3-hydroxy-4-methyldecanoic acid.
