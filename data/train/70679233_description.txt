The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide comprised of a hexasaccharide chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, alpha-D-mannose, beta-D-mannose, and two N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues linked sequentially (1->4), (1->2), (1->3), (1->4) and (1->4), to the beta-D-mannose residue of which is (1->6)-linked an alpha-D-mannose residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino heptasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
