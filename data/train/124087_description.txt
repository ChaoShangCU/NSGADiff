The molecule is loratadine in which the ethoxycarbonyl group attached to the piperidine ring is replaced by hydrogen. The major metabolite of loratidine, desloratadine is an antihistamine which is used for the symptomatic relief of allergic conditions including rhinitis and chronic urticaria. It does not readily enter the central nervous system, so does not cause drowsiness. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, an anti-allergic agent and a cholinergic antagonist.
