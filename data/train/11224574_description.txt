The molecule is an oxindole that is 5-amino-oxindole in which the 5-amino group has undergone formal condensation with the carboxy group of 3-(piperidin-1-yl)propanoic acid to give the corresponding carboxamide and in which the hydrogens at position 3 have been replaced by a (5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene group (Z configuration). It is an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) dimerisation. It has a role as an ERK dimerisation inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of piperidines, a member of oxindoles, an enamide and a secondary carboxamide.
