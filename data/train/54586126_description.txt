The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is 3,15,16,28-tetrahydroxyolean-12-en-22-yl (2Z)-2-methylbut-2-enoate attached to a tetrasaccharide residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the stems of Gordonia chrysandra, it exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a tetrasaccharide derivative and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from an angelic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
