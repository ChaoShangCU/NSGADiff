The molecule is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphate resulting from the formal condensation of the hydroxy group at the 5' position of guanosine with pyrophosphoric acid. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and an uncoupling protein inhibitor. It is a guanosine 5'-phosphate and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a GDP(2-).
