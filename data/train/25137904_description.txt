The molecule is a multi-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of pristanic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a multi-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a pristanic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a pristanoyl-CoA(4-).
