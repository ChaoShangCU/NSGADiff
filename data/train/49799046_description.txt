The molecule is a steroid saponin that consists of pennogenin attached to alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycoidic linkage. Isolated from Dracaena mannii, it exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, an organic heterohexacyclic compound, an oxaspiro compound, a disaccharide derivative and a steroid saponin. It derives from a pennogenin.
