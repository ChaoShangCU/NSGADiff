The molecule is a pyrazolopyrimidine that is pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine which is substituted at positions 3 and 6 by pyridin-4-yl and p-[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenyl groups, respectively. It is a potent, selective, reversible, and ATP-competitive inhibitor of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase, EC 2.7.11.31) and a selective inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.31 {[hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)] kinase} inhibitor and a bone morphogenetic protein receptor antagonist. It is a pyrazolopyrimidine, a member of piperidines, an aromatic ether and a member of pyridines.
