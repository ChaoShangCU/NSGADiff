The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is the cinnamate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxylic group of cis-caffeic acid with the hydroxy group of lupeol (the 3beta stereoisomer). It is isolated from the fruits of Bruguiera parviflora and exhibits antimalarial activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antimalarial. It is a cinnamate ester, a member of catechols and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a cis-caffeic acid and a lupeol. It derives from a hydride of a lupane.
