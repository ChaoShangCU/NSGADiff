The molecule is a trisaccharide that is D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 2 has been converted to the corresponding alpha-D-glucopyranoside, while that at position 1 has been converted into the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranoside. It is an oligosaccharide, a trisaccharide, an alpha-D-glucoside and a beta-D-glucoside.
