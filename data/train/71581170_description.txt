The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (23Z,26Z,29Z,32Z,35Z)-3-oxooctatriacontapentaenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (23Z,26Z,29Z,32Z,35Z)-3-oxooctatriacontapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
