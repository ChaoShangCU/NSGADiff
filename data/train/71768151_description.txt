The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the phosphate to the amino group of 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; major species at pH 7.3. It derives from an arachidonic acid. It is a tautomer of a 2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
