The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glcopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 6 have each been converted into the corresponding alpha-L-fucopyranosyl derivative. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->6)-D-GlcpNAc.
