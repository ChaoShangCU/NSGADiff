The molecule is a steroid acid resulting from stereoselective oxidation of one of the terminal methyl groups of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol to the corresponding carboxylic acid. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a steroid acid, a monocarboxylic acid, a cholestanoid, a 3beta-sterol, a 4-hydroxy steroid, an oxysterol and a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid. It is a conjugate acid of a (25R)-3beta,4beta-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oate(1-).
