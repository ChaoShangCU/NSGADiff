The molecule is a catechol-type siderophore with a structure of D-lysyl-L-serine substituted on N(2) of the lysyl residue by a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl group. It is produced by the Gram-negative bacillus Dickeya dadantii (previously known as Erwinia chrysanthem). Only the catecholate hydroxyl groups participate in metal coordination, so chrysobactin cannot provide full 1:1 coordination of Fe(III); at neutral pH and concentrations of about 0.1 mM, ferric chrysobactin exists as a mixture of bis and tris complexes. It has a role as a siderophore and a bacterial metabolite. It is a member of catechols, a dipeptide, a monocarboxylic acid, a primary alcohol and a primary amino compound.
