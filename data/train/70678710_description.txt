The molecule is a linear amino trisaccharide that consists of a 6-sulfated N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamyl residue flanked by two beta-D-glucuronic acid units connected by (1->4)-linkages. An intermediate glycan involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is an amino trisaccharide, a carbohydrate acid derivative and an oligosaccharide sulfate.
