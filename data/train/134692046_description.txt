The molecule is a branched oligosaccharide comprising eleven D-arabinofuranose units, in an assembly consisting of two of the arabinose residues linked alpha(1->5), with beta-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl and beta-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl-(1->5)-alpha-arabinosyl-(1->5)-alpha-arabinosyl-(1->5)-alpha-arabinosyl-(1->5)-alpha-arabinosyl-(1->5)-alpha-arabinosyl units linked to respectively the 3- and 5-positions of the arabinose residue distal from the reducing-end residue.
