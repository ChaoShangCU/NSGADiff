The molecule is a 19-membered macrocyle that is geldanamycin in which the methoxy substituent attached to the benzoquinone moiety has been replaced by an allylamino group. It is a potent inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). A less toxic analogue than geldanamycin, it induces apoptosis and displays antitumour effects. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a Hsp90 inhibitor and an apoptosis inducer. It is a secondary amino compound, an ansamycin, a carbamate ester, an organic heterobicyclic compound and a member of 1,4-benzoquinones. It derives from a geldanamycin.
