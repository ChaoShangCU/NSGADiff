The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 6 have been converted into the corresponding beta-D-galactopyranosyl derivatives. It is a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-alpha-D-GalNAc.
