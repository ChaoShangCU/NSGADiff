The molecule is a linear amino pentasaccharide comprising N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine at the reducing end with an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl moiety at the 4-position. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
