The molecule is a guaiacyl lignin that is medioresinol in which one of the phenolic hydrogens is replaced by a guaiacylglycerol group. It is found in Arabidopsis thaliana. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a dimethoxybenzene, a furofuran, a guaiacyl lignin, a primary alcohol, a secondary alcohol and a polyphenol. It derives from a guaiacylglycerol.
