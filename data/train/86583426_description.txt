The molecule is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) oxanion arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of 12-methyloctadecanoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3 It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a 12-methyloctadecanoyl-CoA.
