The molecule is a hepoxilin having (5Z,9E,14Z) double bond stereochemistry, a 10-hydroxy substituent and an (11S,12S)-epoxy group. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and an algal metabolite. It is a hepoxilin, an epoxy fatty acid, a long-chain fatty acid, a trienoic fatty acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It derives from an all-cis-icosa-5,8,14-trienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a hepoxilin B3(1-).
