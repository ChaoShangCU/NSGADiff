The molecule is an aromatic ketone that is phloroglucinol in which two of the hydrogens attached to the benzene ring have been replaced by chlorines while the third has been replaced by a hexanoyl group. It is the immediate biosynthetic precursor for differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1). DIF-1 is released by developing Dictyostelium amoebae, inducing them to differentiate into stalk cells. It has a role as a eukaryotic metabolite. It is an aromatic ketone, a benzenetriol and a dichlorobenzene. It is a conjugate acid of a (3,5-dichloro-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)hexan-1-one(1-).
