The molecule is a guaiacyl lignin obtained by formal cyclocodensation between guaiacylglycerol and esculetin. It is found in Arabidopsis thaliana. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a guaiacyl lignin, a primary alcohol, a member of coumarins, a member of guaiacols and a pyranobenzodioxin. It derives from an esculetin and a guaiacylglycerol.
