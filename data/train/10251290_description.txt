The molecule is a maleate salt obtained by reaction of 1-[1-(1-benzothiophen-2-yl)cyclohexyl]piperidine with one equivalent of maleic acid. A potent dopamine re-uptake inhibitor with a behavioral profile different from that of PCP and similar to that of cocaine. It has a role as a dopamine uptake inhibitor. It contains a 1-[1-(1-benzothiophen-2-yl)cyclohexyl]piperidinium(1+).
