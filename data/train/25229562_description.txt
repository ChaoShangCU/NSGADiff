The molecule is a branched amino trisaccharide comprising an N -acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine residue at the reducing end, to which are (1->3)- and (1->6)-linked two N -acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine residues. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino trisaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
