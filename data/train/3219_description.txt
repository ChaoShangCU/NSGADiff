The molecule is 1-Methyl-1,4-diazepane in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen at position 4 is substituted by a 1-(2-ethoxyethyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl group. A relatively selective histamine H1 antagonist, it is used as the difumatate salt for allergic rhinitis, urticaria, and pruritic skin disorders, and in eyedrops for the symptomatic relief of allergic conjuntivitis. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, an anti-allergic agent and an antipruritic drug.
