The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoic acid. It is a member of n-3 PUFA and by-product of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a timnodonoyl bioconjugate. It is a conjugate acid of a (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
