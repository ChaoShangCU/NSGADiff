The molecule is a nitrile oxide that is pentane in which two of the terminal methyl hydrogens at positions 1 and 5 have been replaced by oxidonitrile and methylsulfanyl groups. It has a role as an Arabidopsis thaliana metabolite. It is a nitrile oxide and a methyl sulfide. It derives from a hydride of a pentane.
