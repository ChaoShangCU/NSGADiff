The molecule is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate that is adenosine 5'-monophosphate in which one of the hydroxy groups of the phosphate has been condensed with the carboxylic acid group of D-alanine. It is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate and a D-alanine derivative. It derives from an adenosine 5'-monophosphate. It is a tautomer of a D-alanyl-AMP zwitterion.
