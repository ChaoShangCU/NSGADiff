The molecule is a ginsenoside found in Panax japonicus var. major that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 12beta and 20 pro-R positions, in which the hydroxy group at position 3 has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is a ginsenoside, a glycoside and a tetracyclic triterpenoid.
