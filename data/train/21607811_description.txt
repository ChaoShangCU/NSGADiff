The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is composed of soyasapogenol B having a beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid moiety attached at the 3-position via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a hepatoprotective agent and a prodrug. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a soyasapogenol B. It is a conjugate acid of a soyasaponin III(1-).
