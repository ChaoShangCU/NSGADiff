The molecule is a linear trisaccharide derivative that consists of 2-sulfated beta-D-glucuronic acid, 6-sulfated N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine and beta-D-glucuronic acid units connected in sequence by (1->4)-linkages. An intermediate glycan involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate. It is a carbohydrate acid derivative, an oligosaccharide sulfate and an amino trisaccharide.
