The molecule is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which a hydrogen attached to one of the nitrogens is replaced by a 2,6-dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl group, while the hydrogens attached to the other nitrogen are replaced by a methyl group and a 6-{[4-(4-ethylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]amino}pyrimidin-4-yl group. It is a potent and selective fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor. It has a role as a fibroblast growth factor receptor antagonist and an antineoplastic agent. It is an aminopyrimidine, a N-arylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, a dichlorobenzene and a member of phenylureas.
