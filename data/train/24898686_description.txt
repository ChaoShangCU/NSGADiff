The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is A,B-dihomo-19-nor-4-oxalanosta-1,8,19,24-tetraen-26,22-olide substituted by an acetoxy group at position 15, a hydroxy group at position 23 and an oxo group at position 3 (the 22S, 23R stereoisomer). It is isolated from the fruiting bodies of the Vietnamese mushroom Ganoderma colossum and displays inhibitory activity towards the enzyme HIV protease. It has a role as a metabolite and a HIV protease inhibitor. It is a delta-lactone, an acetate ester, an epsilon-lactone, a tetracyclic triterpenoid and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a hydride of a lanostane.
