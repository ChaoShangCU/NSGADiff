The molecule is an L-proline derivative that is the ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of L-proline with the 3'-hydroxy group of AMP. It has a role as a Mycoplasma genitalium metabolite. It is an adenosine 5'-phosphate, a L-proline derivative, an alpha-amino acid ester and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It derives from an adenosine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a 3'-L-prolyl-AMP(1-).
