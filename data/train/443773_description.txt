The molecule is an isoquinoline alkaloid that is the biaryl resulting from substitution of the hydrogen at the 7-position of (1R,3R)-1,3-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-8-ol by a 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methylnaphthalen-1-yl group. It is a naphthylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the roots and stem barks of Triphyophyllum peltatum and exhibits antifungal, antimalarial, antineoplastic and molluscicidal activites. It has a role as an antimalarial, an antifungal agent, a molluscicide and a metabolite. It is an isoquinoline alkaloid, a member of methylnaphthalenes, a methoxynaphthalene, a member of isoquinolines and a biaryl.
