The molecule is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion resulting from the removal of a proton from the carboxy and sulfate groups of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-D-galactopyranose arising from deprotonation of carboxylic acid and sulfate functions. It is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion, a monocarboxylic acid anion and an organosulfate oxoanion. It is a conjugate base of a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-D-galactopyranose.
