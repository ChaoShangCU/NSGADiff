The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside that is the 2-azidoethyl glycoside of a tetrasaccharide (Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 tetrasaccharide) consisting of two beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl disaccharide units linked (1->3). It has a role as an antigen. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a tetrasaccharide derivative and an azide.
