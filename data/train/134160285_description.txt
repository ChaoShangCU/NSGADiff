The molecule is an oligosaccharide derivative consisting of two alpha-D-galacturonosyl-(1->3)-alpha-D-galacturonosyloxy disaccharide units linked via a dithiodiethyl divalent group. One of a panel of synthetic oligosaccharide derivatives designed to reveal a critical role of the rare aminosugar 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4-dideoxy-D-fucose (2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-galactose; D-AAT) for serotype 1 immune recognition (PMID:29632881). It is an oligosaccharide derivative and an organic disulfide.
