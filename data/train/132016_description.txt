The molecule is a lactam that is 4-hydroxyazacyclotetradecan-2-one substituted by an ethyl group at position 11, methyl groups at position 3 and 7 and a 3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-talopyranosyl moiety at position 4 via a glycosyl linkage (the 3R,4S,7R,11S stereoisomer). It is isolated from the fermentation broth of an unidentified actinomycete species and exhibits potent inhibitory activity against influenza A virus. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an EC 3.2.1.18 (exo-alpha-sialidase) inhibitor and a metabolite. It is an aminoglycoside, a lactam and a macrocycle.
