The molecule is an acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (E)-4-(trimethylammonio)but-2-enoic acid. It derives from a coenzyme A and an (E)-4-(trimethylammonio)but-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (E)-4-(trimethylammonio)but-2-enoyl-CoA(3-).
