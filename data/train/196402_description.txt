The molecule is a nine-membered macrocycle that incorporates three 6-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuranyl moieties as part of the cyclic skeleton. It is isolated from Caragana chamlague Lamarck and exhibits significant inhibitory effect towards the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent, an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a polyphenol, a macrocycle and a member of 1-benzofurans.
