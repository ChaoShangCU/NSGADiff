The molecule is a dialdehyde in which the two carbaldehyde functions are at positions 3 and 5 of 4-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine. Although the compound is an entity in its own right, the nitrogen of the dihydropyridine ring may also arise from the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue within a protein [MDHDC-protein adduct; malonaldedehyde (synonym malondialdehyde) acetaldehyde (MAA)-protein adduct]. It has a role as an epitope. It is a dialdehyde and a dihydropyridine.
