The molecule is a long-chain (3S)-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxypalmitic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain (3S)-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a palmitoyl-CoA and a (S)-3-hydroxypalmitic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA(4-).
