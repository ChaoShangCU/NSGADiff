The molecule is a monomethoxyflavanone that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by a methoxy group at position 5, hydroxy groups at positions 7 and 4' and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylbut-1-en-1-yl group at position 8. It has been isolated from the aerial parts of Tephrosia candida. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a dihydroxyflavanone, a monomethoxyflavanone, a tertiary alcohol and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from a (2S)-flavanone.
