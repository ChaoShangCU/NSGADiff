The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA resulting from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3E,5Z)-tetradecadienoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (3E,5Z)-tetradecadienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (3E,5Z)-tetradecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
