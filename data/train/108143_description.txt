The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoamide resulting from the condensation of one of the carboxy groups of terephthalic acid with the amino group of 5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-amine. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a retinoic acid receptor alpha/beta agonist. It is a member of tetralins, a retinoid and a dicarboxylic acid monoamide. It derives from a 4-carbamoylbenzoic acid and a terephthalic acid.
