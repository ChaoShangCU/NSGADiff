The molecule is an amino sugar phosphate that is 4-O-[4-O-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminylphospho)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminylphospho]-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine linked glycosidically to a (3-aminopropoxy)(hydroxy)phosphoryl group. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-O-[4-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosylphospho)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosylphospho]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosyl 3-aminopropyl phosphate(3-).
