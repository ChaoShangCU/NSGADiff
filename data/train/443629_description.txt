The molecule is a member of the class of validamycins that is (1R,2S,3S,4S,6R)-4-amino-6-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane-1,2,3-triol in which the hydroxy group at position 1 has been converted to its beta-D-glucoside and in which one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a (1R,4R,5R,6S)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohex-2-en-1-yl group. It is the major validamycin produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. It has a role as an EC 2.4.1.231 [alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase (configuration-retaining)] inhibitor, an EC 2.4.1.64 (alpha,alpha-trehalose phosphorylase) inhibitor, an EC 3.2.1.28 (alpha,alpha-trehalase) inhibitor and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of validamycins, a secondary amino compound, a polyol and an antibiotic fungicide. It is a conjugate base of a validamycin A(1+).
