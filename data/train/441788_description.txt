The molecule is a quassinoid that is 13,20-epoxypicras-3-ene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 1, 11, 12, 14 and 15 and oxo groups at positions 2 and 16. Isolated from the ethanol extract of the stem of Brucea mollis, it exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a delta-lactone, a pentol, a quassinoid, an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a hydride of a picrasane.
