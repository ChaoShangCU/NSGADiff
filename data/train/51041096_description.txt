The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is asiatic acid attached to a a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 28. Isolated from the methanolic extract of the leaves of Symplocos lancifolia, it exhibits antibacterial activity. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from an asiatic acid. It derives from a hydride of an ursane.
