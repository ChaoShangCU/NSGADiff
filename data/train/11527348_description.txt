The molecule is an O-acyl carbohydrate consisting of glucose attached to 2-hydroxy-4-vanilloyloxymethylphenyl and trans-caffeoyl group at positions 1 and 6 respectively. Isolated from stems of Ilex latifolia, it exhibits inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase and lipase. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 3.2.1.20 (alpha-glucosidase) inhibitor and an EC 3.1.1.3 (triacylglycerol lipase) inhibitor. It is a cinnamate ester, a polyphenol, a beta-D-glucoside and an O-acyl carbohydrate. It derives from a trans-caffeic acid and a vanillic acid.
