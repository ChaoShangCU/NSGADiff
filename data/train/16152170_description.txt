The molecule is a glycopeptide consisting of a macropolycyclic heptapeptide in which a phenolic hydroxy group has been converted to its alpha-D-mannoside while a secondary alcohol group has been converted to the corresponding 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucoside. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a polyol, a glycopeptide, a member of acetamides, a macrocycle, a member of monochlorobenzenes, a polyphenol and an aromatic ether.
