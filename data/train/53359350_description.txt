The molecule is a member of the class of dihydroisocoumarins that is hydrangenol attached to a 3-O-(6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 4' via a glycosidic linkage. It has been isolated from the roots of Scorzonera judaica. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a member of dihydroisocoumarins, a disaccharide derivative and a member of phenols. It derives from a hydrangenol.
