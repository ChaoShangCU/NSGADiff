The molecule is the tricarboxylic acid monoanion that is the conjugate base of (S,S,S)-nicotianamine, resulting from deprotonation of the central carboxy group and zwitterion formation of the other two. One of two major microspecies at physiological pH. It is a conjugate base of a (S,S,S)-nicotianamine.
