The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3R)-3-hydroxytetracosanoic acid [(R)-3-hydroxylignoceric acid]. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R)-3-hydroxytetracosanoyl-CoA(4-).
