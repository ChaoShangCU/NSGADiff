The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 5,6-epoxy-(8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 5,6-EET. It is a conjugate acid of a 5,6-epoxy-(8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoyl-CoA(4-).
