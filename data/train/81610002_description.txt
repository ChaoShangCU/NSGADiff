The molecule is a tertiary amino compound that is p-methoxybenzylamine in which the hydrogens attached to the amino group have been replaced by a methyl group and a 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propyl group. Obtained from 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-methyl-N-[(3-methyloxetan-3-yl)methyl]methanamine by hydrolysis of the oxetane moiety using human liver microsomes. It is a diol, a tertiary amino compound and an aromatic ether. It derives from a 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-methyl-N-[(3-methyloxetan-3-yl)methyl]methanamine. It is a conjugate base of a 2-{[(4-methoxybenzyl)(methyl)amino]methyl}-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol(1+).
