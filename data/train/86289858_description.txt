The molecule is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside that derived from reaction of the omega-hydroxy group of (3R)-3,22-dihydroxybehenic acid [(3R)-3,22-dihydroxydocosanoic acid] with alpha-ascarylopyranose. It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside, a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a (3R)-3,22-dihydroxybehenic acid.
