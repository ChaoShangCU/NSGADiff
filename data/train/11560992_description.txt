The molecule is a 3-oxo steroid that is stigmast-4-en-3-one substituted by a hydroxy group at position 22 (the 22R stereoisomer). Isolated from the whole plants of Haloxylon recurvum, it exhibits chymotrypsin inhibitory activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.4.21.1 (chymotrypsin) inhibitor. It is a 22-hydroxy steroid and a 3-oxo-Delta(4) steroid. It derives from a hydride of a stigmastane.
