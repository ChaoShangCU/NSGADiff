The molecule is a phenothiazine derivative in which the phenothiazine tricycle carries a chloro substituent at the 2-position and a 3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]propyl group at N-10. It has a role as a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, a dopaminergic antagonist and an antiemetic. It is a member of phenothiazines, a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine and an organochlorine compound. It derives from a hydride of a 10H-phenothiazine.
