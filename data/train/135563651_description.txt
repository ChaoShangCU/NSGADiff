The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acid anion obtained by the formal deprotonation of the carboxy group of 2-hydroxydodec-2-enoic acid [the (minor) enol tautomer of 2-oxododecanoic acid]; major microspecies of the enol tautomer at pH 7.3. It is a medium-chain fatty acid anion, a 2-hydroxy fatty acid anion, a hydroxy monounsaturated fatty acid anion and an enol. It derives from a dodecanoate. It is a conjugate base of a 2-hydroxydodec-2-enoic acid. It is a tautomer of a 2-oxododecanoate.
