The molecule is a nucleotide-sugar oxoanion that is the trianion of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-N(6)-(L-alanyl)-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine having anionic diphosphate and carboxy groups and a cationic amino group. It is a peptide anion and a nucleotide-sugar oxoanion. It is a conjugate base of an UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-N(6)-(L-alanyl)-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine.
