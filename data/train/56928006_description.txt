The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosapentaenoic acid. It is a member of the n-3 PUFA and is the product of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-tetracosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
