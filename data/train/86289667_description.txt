The molecule is a linear mannotriose consisting of three D-mannose units joined by beta-(1->2)-linkages (with beta-configuration at the reducing-end anomeric centre). Present in the cell wall phosphomannan of Candida albicans. It has a role as an epitope. It is a beta-D-Manp-(1->2)-beta-D-Manp-(1->2)-D-Manp and a mannotriose.
