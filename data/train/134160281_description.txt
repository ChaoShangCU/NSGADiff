The molecule is a linear trisaccharide derivative consisting of N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine, alpha-L-rhamnose and N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine residues linked sequentially (1->2) and (1->4) with the N-acetylgalactosamine residue linked glycosidically to a 5-aminopentyl group. It is a trisaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
