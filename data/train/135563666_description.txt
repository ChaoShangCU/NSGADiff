The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside resulting from the formal condensation of the 1R-hydroxy group of beta-D-glucose with the 3R-hydroxy group of chenodeoxycholate. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a 7alpha-hydroxy steroid and a carboxylic acid anion. It derives from a chenodeoxycholate and a beta-D-glucose.
