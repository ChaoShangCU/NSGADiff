The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is the carboxylic ester obtained by the formal condensation of the carboxy group of arjunolic acid with beta-D-glucopyranose. It has been isolated from Juglans sinensis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a carboxylic ester, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from an arjunolic acid. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
