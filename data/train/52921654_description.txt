The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose and N-acetyl-beta-D-galactopyranosamine residues joined in sequence with a (1->2)- and a (1->3)-linkage, respectively; alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc in which the configuration at the reducing-end anomeric centre is beta. It is an amino trisaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-D-GalpNAc.
