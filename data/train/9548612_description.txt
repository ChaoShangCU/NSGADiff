The molecule is a tetracyclic diterpenoid that is grayanotoxane in which the pro-R hydrogen at position 14 is substituted by an acetoxy group and in which the 3beta-, 5-, 6beta-, 10-, and 16- positions are substituted by hydroxy groups. It has a role as a phytotoxin, an antihypertensive agent, a metabolite and a neuromuscular agent. It is a tetracyclic diterpenoid, a pentol, a tertiary alcohol, a secondary alcohol and an acetate ester. It derives from a hydride of a grayanotoxane.
