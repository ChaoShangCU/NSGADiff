The molecule is a carbotricyclic compound obtained from the pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Neosartorya fischeri following activation of their polycyclic polyketide prenyltransferase (pcPTase)-containing silent clusters. It exhibits T-cell antiproliferative activity with an IC50 of 3 muM, suggesting a possible physiological role as an immunosuppressive agent. It has a role as an immunosuppressive agent and a fungal metabolite. It is a member of anthracenes, a tertiary alcohol, a cyclic ketone, an acetate ester, a member of phenols, a carbotricyclic compound and a polyketide. It contains a prenyl group.
