The molecule is an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside that is bhos#18 in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the ascarylopyranose moiety has been has been converted to the corresponding 1H-indole-3-carboxylate ester. It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid, a 4-O-(1H-indol-3-ylcarbonyl)ascaroside, an omega-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a bhos#18 and a (3R)-3,11-dihydroxyundecanoic acid.
