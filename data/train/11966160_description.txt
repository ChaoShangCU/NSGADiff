The molecule is a hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (S)-3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a (S)-3-hydroxyhexanoic acid and a coenzyme A. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA(4-).
