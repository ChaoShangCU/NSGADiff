The molecule is an N-glycosylzeatin that is zeatin in which the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen at position 9 of the adenine moiety is replaced by a beta-D-ribofuranosyl group. It has a role as a cytokinin. It is a N-glycosylzeatin and a member of adenosines. It derives from a N-ribosyl-N(6)-isopentenyladenine.
