The molecule is an amino-acid betaine that is trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline zwitterion in which both of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen have been replaced by methyl groups. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an amino-acid betaine, a secondary alcohol and a pyrrolidine alkaloid. It derives from a trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline zwitterion.
