The molecule is an ammonium ion resulting from the protonation of the tertiary amino group of (-)-echitovenine. The major species at pH 7.3. Note the stereoconfiguration of the 19 hydroxy group is based on CHEBI:144373 (and Fig. S10). It is an ammonium ion derivative and an indole alkaloid cation. It is a conjugate acid of a (-)-echitovenine. It is an enantiomer of a (+)-echitovenine(1+).
