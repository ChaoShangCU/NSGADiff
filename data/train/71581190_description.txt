The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-3-oxooctacosapentaenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-3-oxooctacosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
