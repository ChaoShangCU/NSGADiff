The molecule is a branched trisaccharide that is beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the gluocopyranose moiety has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranoside. It is a trisaccharide, a beta-D-galactoside and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp.
