The molecule is a member of the class of cleistanthins that is cleistanthin C in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the 2,3-di-O-methyl-beta-D-xylopyranosyl moiety has been converted to the corresponding 2,3,5-tri-O-methyl-D-xylofuranoside. It is a member of cleistanthins and a trisaccharide derivative. It derives from a cleistanthin C.
