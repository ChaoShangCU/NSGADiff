The molecule is a heterodetic cyclic peptide comprising a cyclopentapeptide made up from L-seryl, L-tyrosyl, L-phenylalanyl, L-isoleucyl and L-methoionyl residues and cyclised by formation of an ester bond between the carboxy group of the methionyl residue and the side-chain hydroxy group of the seryl residue. In addition, the exocyclic amino group is acylated by an L-cysteinylamino)ethoxy]ethoxy}acetyl)-L-tyrosyl-L-seryl-L-threonyl group. It has a role as a hapten.
