The molecule is a glycosyl alditol that is D-glucitol in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4 have been converted to the corresponding 6-deoxy-alpha-L-galactopyranoside (also known as alpha-L-fucoside) and beta-D-galactopyranoside, respectively. It is a galactoside and a glycosyl alditol. It derives from a D-glucitol.
