The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is D-mannopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3 have each been converted into the corresponding 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl derivatives. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-D-Manp, a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and a D-mannopyranose.
