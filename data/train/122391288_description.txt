The molecule is a hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid, obtained by the formal substitution of a hydrogen at position 13 of (9Z,11E,15Z)-octadeca-9,11,15-trienoic acid by a hydroperoxy group (the 13R-stereoisomer). It derives from a (9Z,11E,15Z)-octadeca-9,11,15-trienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (9Z,11E,13R,15Z)-13-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoate. It is an enantiomer of a (9Z,11E,13S,15Z)-13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11,15-trienoic acid.
