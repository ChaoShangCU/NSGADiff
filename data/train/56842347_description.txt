The molecule is a secoiridoid that is the methyl ester of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-5-carboxylic acid which is substituted at positions 2, 3, and 4 by hydroxy, ethylidene, and carboxymethyl groups, respectively and in which the carboxylic acid moiety of the carboxymethyl substituent has been converted to the corresponding 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl ester (the 2R,3E,4S stereoisomer). The most important phenolic compound present in olive cultivars. It has a role as a neuroprotective agent, a TRPA1 channel agonist, a mTOR inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory agent, an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is a methyl ester, a diester, a member of catechols, a member of pyrans, a lactol and a secoiridoid. It derives from an oleuropein.
