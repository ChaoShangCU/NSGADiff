The molecule is a tripeptide that consists of L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-L-glutamic acid in which the the cysteine side chain is substituted by a cyano(indol-3-yl)methyl group. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a S-conjugate, a member of indoles, a nitrile and a tripeptide. It derives from a glutamic acid, a cysteine and an indole-3-acetonitrile. It is a conjugate acid of a gammaGluCys(IAN)Glu(2-).
