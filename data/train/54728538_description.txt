The molecule is an organic heterotricyclic compound and tetramic acid derivative originally isolated from an unidentified oligosporic actinomycete strain (no. E864-861) and found to be active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria as well as some aerobic bacteria such as Streptococci. The methyl ester of nocamycin E. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and a bacterial metabolite. It is a spiroketal, a methyl ester, a gamma-lactam, an organic heterotricyclic compound, an olefinic compound, an enol and a member of tetramic acids. It derives from a nocamycin E. It is a conjugate acid of a nocamycin I(1-).
