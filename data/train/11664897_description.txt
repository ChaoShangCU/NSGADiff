The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that consists of kaempferol attached to a alpha-L-[6'''-p-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-rhamnopyranosyl] moiety at position 3 via a glycosdic linkage. Isolated from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is a disaccharide derivative, a cinnamate ester and a glycosyloxyflavone. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid.
