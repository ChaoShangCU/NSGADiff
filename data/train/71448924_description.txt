The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (11Z)-eicosenoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a Delta(11)-fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of an (11Z)-eicosenoyl-CoA(4-).
