The molecule is a stilbenoid that is trans-stilbene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4' and methoxy groups at positions 2', 3' and 5. Isolated from Pholidota yunnanensis, it exhibits inhibitory effects on production of nitric oxide. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a member of methoxybenzenes, a polyphenol and a stilbenoid.
