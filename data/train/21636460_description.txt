The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is friedelane substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 28 and 29 and an oxo group at position 3. Isolated from the stems of Maytenus diversifolia, it exhibits potent cytotoxicity against the A-549 lung carcinoma cells. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a diol and a cyclic terpene ketone. It derives from a hydride of a friedelane.
