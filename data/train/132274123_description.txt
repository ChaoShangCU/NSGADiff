The molecule is a mannooligosaccharide derivative consisting of a D-mannosyl residue alpha-linked to a 3-aminopropyl group and which carries an alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl unit linked (1->3) and an alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)-alpha-D-mannosyl unit linked (1->6). It is a mannooligosaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
