The molecule is a phosphate salt obtained by reacting 3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole with one equivalent of phosphoric acid. It is a nitrification inhibitor and when used on crops, it prevents nitrogen loss from soil, increases nitrogen use efficiency, and boosts crop yields. It has a role as a nitrification inhibitor. It contains a 3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole.
