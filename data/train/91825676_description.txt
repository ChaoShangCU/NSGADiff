The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide made up from two repeating (1->3)-linked N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-[alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)]-beta-D-galactosyl units that are in turn joined to an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue via a (1->4)-linkage. It is an amino heptasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
