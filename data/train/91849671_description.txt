The molecule is an oligosaccharide sulfate that is 4-deoxy-Delta(4)-beta-D-GlcpA2S-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the 2-acetamido-beta-D-galactopyranose moiety has been converted into the corresponding hydrogen sulfate derivative. It is a member of acetamides, an amino disaccharide, an enol, a monocarboxylic acid and an oligosaccharide sulfate. It derives from a Delta(4)-beta-D-GlcpA-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc4S.
