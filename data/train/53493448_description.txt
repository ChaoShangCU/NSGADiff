The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is oleana-11,13(18)-diene substituted by a alpha-hydroxy group at position 3, an oxo group at position 23 and a carboxy group at position 28. Isolated from the leaves and twigs of Fatsia polycarpa, it exhibits anti-HBV activity. It has a role as an anti-HBV agent, a plant metabolite and an antibacterial agent. It is a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and an aldehyde. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
