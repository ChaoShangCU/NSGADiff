The molecule is an oligopeptide composed of the tripeptide unit beta-alanyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl which is attached via an amide bond to the amino terminus of the pseudopeptide fragment 3-({[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(indol-3-ylacetyl)glycyl]amino}methyl)benzoyl, which is in turn attached via an amide bond to the amino terminus of the tripeptide unit L-leucyl-L-threonyl-L-valine. It has a role as a peptidomimetic.
