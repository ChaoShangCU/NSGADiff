The molecule is a class I yanuthone that is 22-deacetylyanuthone A in which the primary alcohol has been esterified by condensation with one of the carboxy groups of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a class I yanuthone, a dicarboxylic acid monoester, a tertiary alcohol and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a 22-deacetylyanuthone A and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid.
