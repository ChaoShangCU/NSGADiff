The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is 3-O-methylquercetin attached to beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues at positions 7 and 4' respectively via glycosidic linkages. It has been isolated from Ophioglossum pedunculosum. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a monomethoxyflavone, a dihydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxyflavone.
