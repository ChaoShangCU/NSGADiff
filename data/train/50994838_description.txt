The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside in which the anomeric position is substituted by a 4-hydroxyphenoxy residue and the positions 2 and 6 by [(2E)-3-(1-hydroxy-4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-yl)prop-2-enoyl]oxy residues. Isolated from Grevillea, it exhibits antimalarial activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antimalarial. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an enoate ester, a cyclic ketone, a member of phenols and a monosaccharide derivative.
