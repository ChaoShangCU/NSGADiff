The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is (3beta,16alpha)-13,28-epoxyoleanane-3,16-diol attached to a tetrasaccharide residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from aerial parts of Lysimachia clethroides, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a plant metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cyclic ether, a hexacyclic triterpenoid, a tetrasaccharide derivative, a triterpenoid saponin and a secondary alcohol.
