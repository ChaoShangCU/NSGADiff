The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3R,8Z,11Z,14Z)-3-hydroxyicosatrienoic acid. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3R,8Z,11Z,14Z)-3-hydroxyicosatrienoyl-CoA(4-).
