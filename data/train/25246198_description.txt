The molecule is a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of hexacosanoic (cerotic) acid.. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It derives from a hexacosanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a hexacosanoyl-CoA(4-).
