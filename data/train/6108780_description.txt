The molecule is an organosulfonic acid comprising stilbene having 4-anilino-6-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl}amino groups at the 4 and 4'-positions and sulfo groups at the 2- and 2'-positions. It has a role as a fluorochrome. It is an organosulfonic acid and a member of 1,3,5-triazines. It is a conjugate acid of a 4,4'-bis({4-anilino-6-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl}amino)stilbene-2,2'-disulfonate. It derives from a hydride of a stilbene.
