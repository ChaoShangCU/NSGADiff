The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-oxodocosapentaenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-3-oxodocosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
