The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid that is acetic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens is substituted by a 1,8-diethyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydropyrano[3,4-b]indol-1-yl moiety. A preferential inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase 2 and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, it is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and for the alleviation of postoperative pain. Administered as the racemate, only the (S)-enantiomer is active. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a non-narcotic analgesic and an antipyretic. It is a monocarboxylic acid and an organic heterotricyclic compound.
