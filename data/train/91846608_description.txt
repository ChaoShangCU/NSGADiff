The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of beta-D-glucopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
