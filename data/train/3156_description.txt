The molecule is a member of the class of pyrrolidin-2-ones that is N-ethylpyrrolidin-2-one in which both of the hydrogens at the 3 position (adjacent to the carbonyl group) are substituted by phenyl groups, and one of the hydrogens at the 4 position is substituted by a 2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethyl group. A central and respiratory stimulant with a brief duration of action, it is used (generally as the hydrochloride or the hydrochloride hydrate) as a temporary treatment of acute respiratory failure, particularly when superimposed on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and of postoperative respiratory depression. It has also been used for treatment of postoperative shivering. It has a role as a central nervous system stimulant. It is a member of morpholines and a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones.
