The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprised of a linear sequence of N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues linked (2->3) and (1->3), to the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue of which is also linked (1->6) a linear trisaccharide sequence of N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues linked (2->3) and (1->4). It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and an amino hexasaccharide.
