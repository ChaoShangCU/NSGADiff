The molecule is an oligosaccharide derivative that is an octasaccharide derivative consisting of an irregular string of NHAcetyl-substituted and O-sulfated monosaccharide residues with a Delta(4,5)HexUAalpha1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) disaccharide unit at the non-reducing end. It has been isolated from a partial chondroitinase ABC digest of a commercial shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate (CS-C) preparation. It has a role as a mimotope.
