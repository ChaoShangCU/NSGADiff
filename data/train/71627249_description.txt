The molecule is a linear tetrapyrrole anion obtained by deprotonation of both the carboxy groups of 5-oxo-delta-bilirubin (more correctly known as 10-oxo-delta-bilirubin; see comment). It is a linear tetrapyrrole anion and a dicarboxylic acid dianion. It is a conjugate base of a 5-oxo-delta-bilirubin.
