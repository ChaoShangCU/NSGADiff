The molecule is a hydroperoxy fatty acid anion that is the conjugate base of (R)-2-hydroperoxy-alpha-linolenic acid, obtained by deprotonation of the carboxy group; major species at pH 7.3. It is a long-chain fatty acid anion, a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion, a hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoate, a hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acid anion and a (2R)-2-hydroperoxy fatty acid anion. It derives from an alpha-linolenate. It is a conjugate base of a (R)-2-hydroperoxy-alpha-linolenic acid.
