The molecule is an S-conjugate that is the S-cyano(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl derivative of L-cysteine. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a S-conjugate, a member of indoles, a nitrile and a L-cysteine thioether. It derives from an indole-3-acetonitrile. It is a tautomer of a L-Cys(IAN) zwitterion.
