The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid diamide that is N-phenyl-N'-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide in which the hydrogen at position 4 on the phenyl ring is substituted by a (6,7-dimethoxyquinolin-4-yl)oxy group. A multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, used (as its malate salt) for the treatment of progressive, metastatic, medullary thyroid cancer. It has a role as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of quinolines, an organofluorine compound, an aromatic ether and a dicarboxylic acid diamide.
