The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)benzoic acid with the primary amino group of piperidin-2-ylmethylamine. An antiarrhythmic agent used (in the form of its acetate salt) to prevent and treat tachyarrhythmia (abnormal fast rhythm of the heart). It has a role as an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a member of piperidines, an organofluorine compound and an aromatic ether. It is a conjugate base of a flecainide(1+).
