The molecule is a pyrrolopyrimidine obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (6S)-4-oxo-4,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid with the amino group of (R)-[(2R,5S)-5-(4-aminobenzyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl](phenyl)methanol. It is a beta3-adrenergic receptor agonist currently in clinical development for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic agonist. It is a secondary alcohol, a member of pyrrolidines, a member of benzenes, a secondary carboxamide, a pyrrolopyrimidine and a secondary amine.
