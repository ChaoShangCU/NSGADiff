The molecule is a polyketide that is deoxyspectinabilin in which the tetramethyldeca-tetraen-1-yl chain attached to the 4-pyranone moiety has undergone oxidation at position 1 and at the methyl group at position 3 to afford the corresponding tetrahydrofuranyl moiety. Produced by Streptomyces spectabilis, it exhibits antiviral and antimalarial activity. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an antiplasmodial drug, an antiviral agent and a nematicide. It is a member of 4-pyranones, a C-nitro compound, a polyketide, a member of oxolanes and a ketene acetal. It derives from a deoxyspectinabilin.
