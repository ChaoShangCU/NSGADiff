The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-3-oxotetracosahexaenoyl-CoA. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a very long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-3-oxotetracosahexaenoyl-CoA.
