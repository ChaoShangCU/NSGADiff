The molecule is a sulfur-containing amino acid in which the gamma-carbon atoms of two molecules of L-aminobutyric acid are joined via a thioether linkage. It is a byproduct of cystathionine-gamma-lyase and a possible human hyperhomocysteinemia marker. It is a sulfur-containing amino acid, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and an organic sulfide.
