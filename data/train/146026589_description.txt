The molecule is an azaspiro compound resulting from the spiro-fusion of 2-imino-1,3-diazinan-4-one at position 6 with 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane. It is a marine metabolite isolated from Vietnamese pufferfish Tetraodon biocellatus and a potential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the synthesis of tetrodotoxin. It has a role as an animal metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is an azaspiro compound and an organic heterobicyclic compound.
