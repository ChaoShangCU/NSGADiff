The molecule is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate that is adenosine 5'-monophosphate in which one of the hydroxy groups of the phosphate has been condensed with the carboxylic acid group of L-serine. It is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate and a L-serine derivative. It derives from an adenosine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a L-seryl-AMP(1-).
