The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion that is the conjugate base of archaeal dolichyl N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl phosphate arising from deprotonation of the phosphate OH group; major species at pH 7.3. Dolichol used by archaea is is generally much shorter (C55-C60) than that used by eukaryotes and may have additional saturation positions in the chain. It derives from an archaeal dolichol.
