The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5, 7 and 5', methyl group at positions 6 and 8 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy residue at position 2'. Isolated from the leaves of Myrcia multiflora, it exhibits inhibitory activity against aldose reductase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor. It is a trihydroxyflavanone, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-D-glucoside.
