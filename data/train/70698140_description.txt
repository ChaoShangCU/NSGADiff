The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol attached to a beta-D-apiofuranosyl group at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the aerial parts of Vicia faba and Lotus edulis, it exhibits inhibitory activity against topoisomerase II. It has a role as a metabolite, a plant metabolite and an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor. It is a dihydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone and an alpha-L-rhamnoside. It derives from a kaempferol.
