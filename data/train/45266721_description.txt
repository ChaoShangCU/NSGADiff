The molecule is an acyl-CoA(4-) that is the tetraanion of (25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oyl-CoA arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a (25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oyl-CoA.
