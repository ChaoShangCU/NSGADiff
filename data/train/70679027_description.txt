The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide comprised of a linear chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues, linked sequentially (1->4), (1->3), and (1->4), to each N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue of which is linked an alpha-L-fucosyl residue, the linkages being (1->4) to the reducing-end N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue and (1->3) to the more distal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
