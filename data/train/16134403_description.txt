The molecule is a heterodetic cyclic peptide consisting of N-acylated trytophan, 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenylglycine, 4-hydroxyphenylglycine, 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenylglycyl, tyrosine and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine residues joined in sequence and in which the side-chain of the central 4-hydroxyphenylglycine residue is attached to the side-chain of the tryptophan via a C3-C6 bond and to the side-chain of the tyrosine via an ether bond from C5. It is isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces and has anti-HIV-1 activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an antimicrobial agent and an anti-HIV-1 agent. It is a member of indoles, a cyclic ether, a heterodetic cyclic peptide, an organochlorine compound, a peptide antibiotic and a polyphenol.
