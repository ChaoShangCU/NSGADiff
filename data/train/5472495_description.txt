The molecule is a sulfone metabolite of sulindac that inhibits cell growth by inducing apoptosis independently of cyclooxygenase inhibition. It inhibits the development and induces regression of premalignant adenomatous polyps. Lipoxygenase and Cox-2 inhibitor. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor and an apoptosis inducer. It is a sulfone, a monocarboxylic acid and an organofluorine compound. It derives from a sulindac.
