The molecule is an organic anion derived from prohexadione by deprotonation of both the carboxy group and a hydroxy group of any of the enolate forms of the triketo moiety. The corresponding calcium salt, prohexadione-calcium, is used as an anti-lodging agent in small-grain cereals. It has a role as a plant growth regulator and a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a conjugate base of a prohexadione.
