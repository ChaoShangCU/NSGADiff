The molecule is a steroidal acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (24E)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholest-24-en-26-oic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a (24E)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholest-24-en-26-oyl-CoA(4-).
