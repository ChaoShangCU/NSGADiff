The molecule is an ammonium ion derivative resulting from the protonation of the tertiary amino group of 19-O-acetylhoerhammericine. The major species at pH 7.3. Note the stereoconfiguration of the epoxy group is based on CHEBI:144374, and of the 19-acetoxy group on CHEBI:144372. It is an ammonium ion derivative and an indole alkaloid cation. It is a conjugate acid of a 19-O-acetylhoerhammericine.
