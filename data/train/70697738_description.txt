The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is dammarane with an exocyclic double bond at C-25 and substituent hydroxy groups at positions 3, 6, 12, 20, 22 and 24 (the 3beta,6alpha,12beta,24S stereoisomer). It is isolated from the leaves of Panax ginseng and exhibits cytotoxicity in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a hexol and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
