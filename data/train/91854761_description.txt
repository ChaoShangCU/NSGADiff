The molecule is a branched amino nonasaccharide comprising a linear heptasaccharide chain consisting of N-acetylalpha-neuraminic acid, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose, and beta-D-glucose residues, linked sequentially (2->3), (1->4), (1->3), (1->4), (1->3), and (1->4), with alpha-L-fucosyl residues linked (1->3) to each of the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues. It is a member of N-acetylneuraminic acids and an amino nonasaccharide.
