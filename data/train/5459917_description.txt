The molecule is a 5-carbon, bis-unsaturated, alpha-hydroxy fatty acid metabolite of the proteobacterium substrate 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA). It is a 2-hydroxy fatty acid, an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It derives from a penta-2,4-dienoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate. It is a tautomer of a 2-oxopent-4-enoic acid.
