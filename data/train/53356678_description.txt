The molecule is a carbon oxoacid that is carbonic acid in which one of the hydrogens is replaced by a nitrosoxy group. At physiological pH, nitrosoperoxycarbonic acid is highly unstable, rapidly decomposing to give CO2, NO2, and hydroxyl radicals. It is a carbon oxoacid, a nitroso compound and an organic peroxide. It is a conjugate acid of a nitrosoperoxycarbonate(1-).
