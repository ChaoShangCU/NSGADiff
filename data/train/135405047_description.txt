The molecule is the 5,10-methenyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid arising from enzymatic cyclisation of 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a (6R)-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (6R)-5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate.
