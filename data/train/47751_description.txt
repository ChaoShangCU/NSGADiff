The molecule is an N-glycosyl-1,3,5-triazine that is 4-amino-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one substituted by a beta-D-arabinofuranosyl residue via an N-glycosidic linkage. A synthetic analogue of cytosine arabinoside and 5-azacytidine that incorporates structural features of both compounds, it shows good activity against a variety of transplanted tumors. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a N-glycosyl-1,3,5-triazine and a nucleoside analogue. It derives from a beta-D-arabinofuranose.
