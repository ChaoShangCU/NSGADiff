The molecule is a lipopeptide that contains N-methylphenylalanine and lysine as the amino acid residues linked to a octanoyl moiety via an amide linkage (the R,R stereoisomer). It is isolated from the deep sea sponge Aaptos ciliata and exhibits antileishmanial and moderate cytotoxicity towards HeLa cells. It has a role as a metabolite, an antileishmanial agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of caprolactams and a lipopeptide. It derives from an octanoic acid.
