The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine in which the acyl group is specified as (9S,11R)-epidioxy-(15S)-hydroxy-(5Z,13E)-prostadienoyl. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, a prostanoid and a secondary allylic alcohol. It derives from a prostaglandin H2. It is a tautomer of a 2-[(9S,11R)-epidioxy-(15S)-hydroxy-(5Z,13E)-prostadienoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion.
