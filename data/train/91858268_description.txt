The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronic acid and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. It is an amino disaccharide, a member of acetamides, an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, an enol, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a glycosylglucose derivative. It derives from a 4,5-dehydro-D-glucuronic acid and a N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine.
