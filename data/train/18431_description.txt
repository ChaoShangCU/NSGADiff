The molecule is a long-chain primary fatty alcohol that is tricosane in which a hydrogen attached to one of the terminal carbons is replaced by a hydroxy group. It has been isolated from bulbs of Polianthes tuberosa, bran from the Italian bread wheat variety Pegaso and its 11 near-isogenic lines, and from the aerial parts of f Centaurea austro-anatolica. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It derives from a hydride of a tricosane.
