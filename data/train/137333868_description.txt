The molecule is an enoate ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2E)-4-{(2S,3R,4R,5S)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-[(2E,4R,5S)-5-hydroxy-4-methylhex-2-en-1-yl]oxan-2-yl}-3-methylbut-2-enoic acid with the alcoholic hydroxy group of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid. It is a monocarboxylic acid, an enoate ester, an enol, a member of oxanes, a secondary allylic alcohol and a homoallylic alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of a marinolate C.
