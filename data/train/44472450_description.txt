The molecule is a carbohydrate lactone formed from alpha-Kdo-(2->8)-alpha-Kdo-OAll by lactone formation between the carboxy group of the non-reducing alpha-Kdo residue and O-7 of the alpha-Kdo-OAll residue. It is a carbohydrate lactone and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from an alpha-Kdo-(2->8)-alpha-Kdo. It is a conjugate acid of an alpha-Kdo-(2->8)-alpha-Kdo-OAll(1-) II(1),I(7)-lactone.
