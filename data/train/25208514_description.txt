The molecule is a diphenylethane that is 1,2-dihydrostilbene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3, 4 and 4' and methoxy groups at C-5 and alpha-position respectively (the S stereoisomer). It is isolated from the stems of Dendrobium candidum and exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is a diphenylethane, a member of catechols and a member of methoxybenzenes. It derives from a hydride of a 1,2-dihydrostilbene.
