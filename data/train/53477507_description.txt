The molecule is a resolvin that is docosa-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-hexaenoic acid which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 7 and 17 positions as well as an oxo group at the 8-position (the 7S,17S-stereoisomer). It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a resolvin, a diol, an oxo fatty acid, an enone, a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone and a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of an 8-oxoresolvin D1(1-).
