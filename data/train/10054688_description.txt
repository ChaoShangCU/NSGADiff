The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (2S)-flavanone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 5, 2' and 5', methyl groups at positions 6 and 8 and a (6''-O-p-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy residue at position 7. Isolated from the leaves of Myrcia multiflora, it exhibits inhibitory activity against aldose reductase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a trihydroxyflavanone and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid.
