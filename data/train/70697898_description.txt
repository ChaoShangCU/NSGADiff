The molecule is a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid that consists of dihydro-beta-agarofuran substituted by an acetoxy group at position 1 and furoyloxy groups at positions 2, 6 and 9 (the 1beta,2beta,6alpha,9alpha stereoisomer). Isolated from Celastrus orbiculatus, it exhibits inhibition of both NF-kappaB activation and nitric oxide production. It has a role as a metabolite and a NF-kappaB inhibitor. It is an acetate ester, a bridged compound, a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid, a cyclic ether and an organic heterotricyclic compound. It derives from a 3-furoic acid.
