The molecule is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride that results from the formal condensation of the phosphoryl group of AMP with the carboxyl group of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It derives from a salicylic acid and an adenosine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a 2-hydroxybenzoyl-AMP(1-).
