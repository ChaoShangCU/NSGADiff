The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of beta-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine in which the galactosyl residue at the non-reducing end has alpha-sialyl and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residues attached via glycosidic linkages at positions 3 and 4 respectively. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
