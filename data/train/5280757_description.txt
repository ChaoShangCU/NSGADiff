The molecule is a member of the class of bryostatins that is (17E)-2-oxooxacyclohexacos-17-ene which is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 4, 10, and 20; an acetoxy group at position 8; methyl groups at positions 9, 9, 18, and 19; 2-methoxy-2-oxoethylidene groups at positions 14 and 24; an (E,E)-octa-2,4-dienoyloxy group at position 21; and with oxygen bridges linking positions 6 to 10, 12 to 16, and 20 to 24. It is one of the most abundant member of the class of bryostatins. It has a role as a marine metabolite, a protein kinase C agonist, an alpha-secretase activator, an antineoplastic agent and an anti-HIV-1 agent. It is a member of bryostatins, an acetate ester, a methyl ester, an enoate ester, a cyclic hemiketal, an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a secondary alcohol.
