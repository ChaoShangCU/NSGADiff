The molecule is a epoxydocosatetraenoic acid obtained by formal epoxidation across the 16,17-double bond of (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,13Z,19Z)-16,17-epoxydocosatetraenoate.
