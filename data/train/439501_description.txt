The molecule is a steroid hormone that is a multi-hydroxylated alpha-L-rhamnosyl cardenoloide. It binds to and inhibits the plasma membrane Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (sodium pump). It has been isolated naturally from Strophanthus gratus. It has a role as an EC 3.6.3.9 (Na(+)/K(+)-transporting ATPase) inhibitor, an EC 3.6.3.10 (H(+)/K(+)-exchanging ATPase) inhibitor, an EC 2.3.3.1 [citrate (Si)-synthase] inhibitor, an EC 3.1.3.41 (4-nitrophenylphosphatase) inhibitor, a plant metabolite, a cardiotonic drug, an ion transport inhibitor and an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a cardenolide glycoside, a steroid hormone, an alpha-L-rhamnoside, a 14beta-hydroxy steroid, a 5beta-hydroxy steroid and an 11alpha-hydroxy steroid. It is a conjugate acid of an ouabain(1-).
