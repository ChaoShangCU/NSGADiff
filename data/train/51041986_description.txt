The molecule is a monosaccharide derivative that is 4'-O-methylrobinetinidol attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3'. Isolated from Acacia mearnsii, it exhibits inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-amylase) inhibitor. It is a catechin, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside, a methoxyflavan and a flavan glycoside. It derives from a robinetinidol.
