The molecule is a furopyran that is 5,6-dihydro-4H-furo[2,3-b]pyran-3(2H)-one which is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 5, methyl groups at positions 2 and 5, and a heptyl group at position 6 (the 2R,4R,5S,6R stereoisomer). Isolated from the mangrove fungus Aigialus parvus BCC 5311 and from Phaeoacremonium sp., an endophytic fungus from Senna spectabilis. It has a role as a fungal metabolite and an antifungal agent. It is a furopyran, a tertiary alcohol, a secondary alcohol, a cyclic ketone and a ketene acetal.
