The molecule is a scalarane sesterterpenoid that is 23-acetoxy-12-epi-deoxoscalarin in which the acetoxy group at position 12 is replaced by a hydroxy group. It has been isolated from the sponge, Hyattella species. It has a role as an animal metabolite. It is an acetate ester, an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a scalarane sesterterpenoid. It derives from a 23-acetoxy-12-epi-deoxoscalarin.
