The molecule is a quercetin O-glucoside that is quercetin substituted by a alpha-L-[6'''-p-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-rhamnopyranosyl] residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Ginkgo biloba, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antioxidant. It is a quercetin O-glucoside, a cinnamate ester and a disaccharide derivative.
