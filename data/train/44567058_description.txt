The molecule is a biflavonoid obtained by coupling of two units of 8,3'-dihydroxy-7,4',5'-trimethoxyflavan resulting in a bond between C-5 positions of the two chromene rings. Isolated from Muntingia calabura, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a biflavonoid, a hydroxyflavan, a methoxyflavan, a polyphenol and a ring assembly.
