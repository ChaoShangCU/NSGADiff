The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid and cyclic ketone that is (1E,4E,8E)-alpha-humulene which is substituted by an oxo group at the carbon atom attached to two double bonds. It is obtained by steam distillation from a type of edible ginger, Zingiber zerumbet Smith, grown particularly in southeast Asia. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent, a plant metabolite and a glioma-associated oncogene inhibitor. It is a sesquiterpenoid and a cyclic ketone. It derives from a hydride of an alpha-humulene.
