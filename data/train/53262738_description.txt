The molecule is a withanolide that is 23,26-epoxyergosta-1,4-diene substituted by a hydroxy group at position 22 and oxo groups at positions 3 and 26. Isolated from a Formosan soft coral Paraminabea acronocephala, it has been found to inhibit the accumulation of the pro-inflammatory iNOS protein. It has a role as an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor and a coral metabolite. It is a gamma-lactone, an ergostanoid, a withanolide, a secondary alcohol and a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid.
