The molecule is a cyclic dicarboximide in which the two carboacyl groups on nitrogen together with the nitogen itself form a 1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione structure. It has a role as an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor. It is a dicarboximide and a member of maleimides. It derives from a maleic acid. It derives from a hydride of a 1H-pyrrole.
