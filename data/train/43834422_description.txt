The molecule is the hydrochloride salt of fenfluramine. It binds to the serotonin reuptake pump, causing inhbition of serotonin uptake and release of serotonin. The resulting increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates. Fenfluramine hydrochloride was used for treatment of diabetes and obesity. It was withdrawn worldwide after reports of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension. It has a role as a serotonin uptake inhibitor, a serotonergic agonist and an appetite depressant. It is a hydrochloride and an organoammonium salt. It contains a fenfluramine.
