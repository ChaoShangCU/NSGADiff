The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-2-hexacosenoic acid. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a trans-2-hexacosenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-2-hexacosenoyl-CoA(4-).
