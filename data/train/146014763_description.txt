The molecule is the hydrochloride salt of 3',4'-difluoro-N-{4'-fluoro-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-yl}-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-carboxamide. It is a beta-catenin/BCL9 protein-protein interaction inhibitor (Ki = 2.1 muM). It has a role as a Wnt signalling inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It contains a 3',4'-difluoro-N-{4'-fluoro-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-yl}-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-carboxamide(2+).
