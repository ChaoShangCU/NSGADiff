The molecule is a fatty amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of cerotic acid with the amino group of (2S,3S,4R)-2-aminononane-1,3,4-triol and in which the primary hydroxy group of the resulting product has been converted to the corresponding alpha-D-galactopyranoside. It is a fatty amide, an alpha-D-galactoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a hexacosanoic acid.
