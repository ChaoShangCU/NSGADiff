The molecule is a zwitterion that is derived from 2,5-diimino-3,4-bis(indol-3-yl)hexanedioic acid by deprotonation of both carboxylic acid groups and protonation of both amino groups; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a tautomer of a 2,5-diimino-3,4-bis(indol-3-yl)hexanedioic acid.
