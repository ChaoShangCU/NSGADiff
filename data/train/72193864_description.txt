The molecule is a quinolone that is 4-quinolone substituted at positions 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 by ethyl, carboxy, amino, fluorine, and cyclohexylamino groups, respectively. It can directly bind to and block the transcription activity of the active forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1), but not the Ser256-phosphorylated form. It induces cell death and growth arrest in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines at low concentrations. It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent, an anti-obesity agent, an autophagy inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer and a forkhead box protein O1 inhibitor. It is a quinolinemonocarboxylic acid, a quinolone, an organofluorine compound, a primary amino compound, a secondary amino compound and a tertiary amino compound.
