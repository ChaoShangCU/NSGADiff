The molecule is an amino hexasaccharide in which an alpha-L-fucosyl residue is linked (1->2) to the mannosyl residue furthest from the reducing end of an alpha-D-GalNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc linear pentasaccharide. It has a role as an epitope. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and an amino hexasaccharide.
