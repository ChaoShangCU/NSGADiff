The molecule is any one of a group of polyprenols made up of varying numbers of cis-linked isoprene units, terminating in an alpha-saturated isoprenoid group containing an alcohol functional group. Dolichol used by archaea is is generally much shorter (C55-C60) than that used by eukaryotes and may have additional saturation positions in the chain. It is an isoprenoid and a polyprenol.
