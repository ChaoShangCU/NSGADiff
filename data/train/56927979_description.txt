The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide comprised of two N-acetylated glucosamine residues sulfated on O-6, and three galactosyl residues, one of which (at the non-reducing end) is sulfated on O-6 while another of which is at the reducing end. It is an intermediate in the keratan sulfate degradation pathway. It has a role as a mouse metabolite.
