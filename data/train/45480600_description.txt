The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of three alpha-L-rhamnose residues [linked sequentially (1->3) and (1->2); one at the reducing end] and two N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminyl residues [one linked (1->3) to the reducing-end rhamnose and the other linked (1->3) to the non-reducing-end rhamnose].
