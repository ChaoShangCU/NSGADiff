The molecule is an aza-steroid that is inasteride in which the tert-butyl group is replaced by a 2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group. A synthetic 4-azasteroid, dutasteride is a selective inhibitor of both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of steroid 5alpha-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts testosterone to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone. Dutasteride is used for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia in men with an enlarged prostate gland. It has a role as an EC 1.3.1.22 [3-oxo-5alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase (NADP(+))] inhibitor and an antihyperplasia drug. It is an aza-steroid, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a delta-lactam. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-androstane.
