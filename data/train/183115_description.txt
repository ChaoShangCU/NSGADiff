The molecule is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid that is trans-3-hydroxycotinine in which the hydroxy hydrogen is replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It has a role as a human urinary metabolite and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid, a member of pyridines and a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones. It derives from a trans-3-hydroxycotinine. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-3-hydroxycotinine beta-D-glucuronide(1-).
