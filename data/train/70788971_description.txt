The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide consisting of a chain of three alpha-sialyl residues, a beta-D-galactosyl residue and a beta-D-glucose residue linked sequentially (2->8), (2->8), (2->3) and (1->4), to the galactosyl residue of which is also linked (1->4) an N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl residue. The carbohydrate moiety of ganglioside GT2. It is an amino hexasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
