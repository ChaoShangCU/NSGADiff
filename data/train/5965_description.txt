The molecule is the methobromide salt of the N,N'-bis[3-(dimethylamino)phenyl carbamate] derivative of 2,13-diazatetradecane. It is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase, with a long duration of action. It is used in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma: in the eye, it causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle, facilitating the outflow of the aqueous humor and so reducing intraocular pressure. It has a role as an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and an EC 3.1.1.7 (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitor. It is a quaternary ammonium salt, a bromide salt and a carbamate ester. It contains a demarcarium.
