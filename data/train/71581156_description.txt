The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z)-3-oxotriacontatetraenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z)-triacontatetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z)-3-oxotriacontatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
