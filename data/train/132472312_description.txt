The molecule is a docosanoid that consists of (8E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying an oxo substituent at position 7. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is an enone, a docosanoid and an oxo fatty acid. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an (8E,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-7-oxodocosapentaenoate.
