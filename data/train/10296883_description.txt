The molecule is a member of the class of maleimides that is maleimide which is substituted at position 3 by an indol-3-yl group and at position 4 by a quinazolin-4-yl group, which in turn is substituted at position 2 by a 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl group. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C and has been investigated as an immunosuppresant in renal transplant patients. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C) inhibitor, an immunosuppressive agent and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine, a member of indoles, a member of quinazolines and a member of maleimides.
