The molecule is a N(6)-acyl-L-lysine arising from reductive N-alkylation of N(6)-acetyl-L-lysine by pyridoxal-5-phosphate. It has a role as an epitope and an antigen. It is an organic phosphate and a N(6)-acyl-L-lysine. It derives from a pyridoxal. It is a conjugate acid of a N(6)-acetyl-N(2)-(5'-phosphonatopyridoxyl)-L-lysinate(2-).
