The molecule is a secondary carboxamide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid with the primary amino group of 3-fluoro-N-{(2S)-1-oxo-3-[(3S)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]propan-2-yl}-L-phenylalaninamide. It is an inhibitor of SARS coronavirus main proteinase and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture (EC50 = 0.72 muM). It has a role as an EC 3.4.22.69 (SARS coronavirus main proteinase) inhibitor and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a secondary carboxamide, a member of pyrrolidin-2-ones, an oligopeptide, an indolecarboxamide, an aldehyde and a member of monofluorobenzenes.
