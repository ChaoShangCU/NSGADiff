The molecule is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (11R)-11-hydroxylauric acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a monocarboxylic acid and an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from an (11R)-11-hydroxylauric acid. It is a conjugate acid of an ascr#20(1-).
