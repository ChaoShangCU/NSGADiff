The molecule is an N-sulfonylurea and sulfuric amide resulting from the formal condensation of sulfuric acid with the primary amino group of 1-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)urea and with the primary amino group of 3-amino-N,N-dimethylbenzamide (1 mol eq. of each). An acetolactate synthase inhibitor, it is used as a pre- and post-emergent herbicide for the treatment of grasses and broad-leaved weeds in rice crops. It has a role as an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor and a herbicide. It is a tertiary carboxamide, a sulfuric amide, a N-sulfonylurea and an aromatic ether.
