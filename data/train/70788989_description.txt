The molecule is a linear amino trisaccharide consisting of an alpha-sialyl residue linked (2->3) to an O-6-sulfated beta-D-galactosyl residue that in turn is linked (1->4) to an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue at the reducing end. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino trisaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an oligosaccharide sulfate.
