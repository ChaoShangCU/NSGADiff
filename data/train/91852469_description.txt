The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucitol which has been glycosylated at position 4 by a beta-D-mannopyranosyl group, which in turn has been glycosylated at positions 3 and 6 by alpha-D-mannopyranosyl groups. It is an amino tetrasaccharide, a member of acetamides and a mannooligosaccharide derivative.
