The molecule is a docosanoid that is (7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 13 and 14. An intermediate of specialised proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a docosanoid, a hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acid, a long-chain fatty acid and a secondary allylic alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of a 13,14(S)-dihydroxy-(7Z,9E,11E,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoate.
