The molecule is an octadecenoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-2-octadecenoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a trans-2-enoyl-CoA, an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA and an octadecenoyl-CoA. It derives from a trans-octadec-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-2-octadecenoyl-CoA(4-).
