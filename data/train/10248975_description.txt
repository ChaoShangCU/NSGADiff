The molecule is an acetate ester obtained from the formal condensation of acetic acid with the hydroxy group at position 1 of 6-[(8Z)-pentadec-8-en-1-yl]benzene-1,2,4-triol. Isolated from the dried fruits of Ardisia colorata, it exhibits scavenging activity towards DPPH radicals and cytotoxicity against murine breast cancer cell line, FM3A. It has a role as a metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and a radical scavenger. It is a member of resorcinols and an acetate ester. It derives from a 6-[(8Z)-pentadec-8-en-1-yl]benzene-1,2,4-triol.
