The molecule is an oligosaccharide sulfate formed by sulfating methyl 6-O-sulfo-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucopyranoside at O-6 of each glucose residue. It is an oligosaccharide derivative, a glycoside and an oligosaccharide sulfate. It is a conjugate acid of an alpha-D-Glcp6S-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp6SOMe(2-).
