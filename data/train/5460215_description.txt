The molecule is an organophosphate oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the carboxy and phosphate OH groups of 7-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is an organophosphate oxoanion, a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and a monocarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a 7-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonic acid.
