The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-12-en-28-oic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 16, 23 and 29 and an oxo group at position 3. It has been isolated from the stem bark of Kalopanax pictus and has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and a cyclic terpene ketone. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.
