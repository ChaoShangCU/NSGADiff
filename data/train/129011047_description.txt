The molecule is a glycoside that consists of three N-formyl-alpha-D-perosamine residues linked sequentially (1->3) and (1->2) and linked at the reducing end glycosidically to a 5-(methoxycarbonyl)pentyl group. It is a glycoside, a methyl ester and a trisaccharide derivative. It derives from an alpha-D-Rhap4NFo-(1->3)-alpha-D-Rhap4NFo-(1->2)-alpha-D-Rhap4NFo.
