The molecule is a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the 3-carboxy group of (3S)-3-carboxy-3-hydroxypropanoic acid. It derives from a (S)-malic acid and a butyryl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3S)-3-carboxy-3-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA(5-).
