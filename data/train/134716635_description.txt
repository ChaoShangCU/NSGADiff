The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is (S)-beta-macrocarpene in which a hydrogen of the methyl group that is attached to a double bond has been replaced by a hydroxy group. The first step in the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene phytoalexin zealexin A1 from (S)-beta-macrocarpene in maize. It is a primary allylic alcohol and a sesquiterpenoid. It derives from a (S)-beta-macrocarpene.
