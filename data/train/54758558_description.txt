The molecule is an oligosaccharide sulfate that is 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl)-beta-D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 2 of the 4-deoxy-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl moiety is converted to the corresponding sulfate derivative. It derives from a beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta(4)-GlcpA-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-deoxy-Delta(4)-beta-D-GlcpA2S-(1->3)-beta-D-GalpNAc(2-).
