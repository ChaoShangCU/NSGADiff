The molecule is a (2S)-2-methylacyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (2S)-2-methylpentadecanoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a (2S)-2-methylacyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (2S)-2-methylpentadecanoyl-CoA(4-).
