The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide consisting of alpha-D-mannose, beta-D-mannose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine joined together in sequence by (1->3), (1->4) and (1->4) glycosidic linkages. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine.
