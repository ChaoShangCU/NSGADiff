The molecule is a dioxo monocarboxylic acid that consists of hydrindane bearing oxo and hydroxy substituents at positions 1 and 5 respectively as well as a 2-carboxyethyl substituent at position 4 (the 3aS,4S,5R,7aS diastereomer). It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is a carbobicyclic compound, a 5-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, an alicyclic ketone, an oxo monocarboxylic acid and a secondary alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-[(3aS,4S,5R,7aS)-5-hydroxy-7a-methyl-1,5-dioxo-octahydroinden-4-yl]propanoate. It derives from a hydride of a hydrindane.
