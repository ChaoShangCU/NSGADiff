The molecule is a ribonucleoside triphosphate oxoanion that is the trianion of adenosine 5'-triphosphate arising from deprotonation of three of the four free triphosphate OH groups. It has a role as a human metabolite, a fundamental metabolite and a cofactor. It is a conjugate base of an ATP and a ({[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(9H-purin-9-yl)oxolan-2-yl]methyl phosphonato}oxy)(phosphonatooxy)phosphinate. It is a conjugate acid of an ATP(4-).
