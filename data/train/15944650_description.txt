The molecule is a seco-androstane that is hexahydro-1H-indene-1,5(4H)-dione which is substituted at the 7a position by a methyl group and at the 4 position by a 1-carboxy-1-hydroxy-4-methyl-5-oxohepta-1,3-dien-7-yl group (the S,S,S-diastereoisomer). It is an enol, a 6-oxo monocarboxylic acid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a 2-hydroxy carboxylic acid, an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and a seco-androstane. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-hydroxy-5,9,17-trioxo-4,5:9,10-disecoandrosta-1(10),2-dien-4-oate.
