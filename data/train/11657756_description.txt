The molecule is a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid that is beta-dihydroagarofuran substituted by methylbutanoyloxy groups at positions 1 and 6, a hydroxy group at position 4, a benzoyloxy group at position 8, a furancarbonyloxy group at positon 9 and an acetyloxy group at position 13. Isolated from Euonymus nanoides, it exhibits cytotoxic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid, a bridged compound, a cyclic ether, an acetate ester and a benzoate ester. It derives from a 3-furoic acid and a 2-methylbutyric acid.
