The molecule is an ammonium ion derivative that is the conjugate acid of 3',4'-difluoro-N-{4'-fluoro-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-yl}-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-carboxamide, obtained by the protonation of the two pyrrolidine moieties. It is the major microspecies at pH 7.3. It is a conjugate acid of a 3',4'-difluoro-N-{4'-fluoro-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-yl}-6-[(3S)-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy][biphenyl]-3-carboxamide.
