The molecule is an amino pentasaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose, beta-D-galactopyranose, and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose joined in sequence by (1->4), (1->3), and (1->4) glycosidic bonds and in which the hydroxy group at position 3 of the non-terminal 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose moiety has been to the corresponding alpha-D-galactopyranoside. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a member of acetamides and an alpha-D-galactoside.
