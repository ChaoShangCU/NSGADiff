The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion obtained by transfer of a proton from the phosphate to the amino group of 2-[(9S,11R)-epidioxy-15(S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,13E)-prostadienoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; major species at pH 7.3. It is a tautomer of a 2-[(9S,11R)-epidioxy-(15S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z,13E)-prostadienoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
