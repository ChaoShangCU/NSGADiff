The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranose, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose and D-galactopyranose residues joined in sequence by (1->4) and (1->3) glycosidic bonds. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a member of acetamides and an amino trisaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->3)-D-Galp and a beta-D-GalpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
