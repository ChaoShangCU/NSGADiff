The molecule is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 12-methyloctadecanoic acid. It is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 12-methyloctadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 12-methyloctadecanoyl-CoA(4-).
