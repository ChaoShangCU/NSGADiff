The molecule is an icosanoid that is leukotriene E4 in which the non-conjugated double bond has been reduced to a single bond and four methylene groups have been lost from the resulting carboxyalkyl chain. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a secondary alcohol, a tricarboxylic acid, a L-cysteine thioether, an icosanoid and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a leukotriene E4.
