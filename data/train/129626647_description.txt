The molecule is a hydroxylamine that is N-hydroxyquinolin-4-one in which the hydrogen at position 2 has been replaced by a (1E)-non-1-en-1-yl group. It is the most active agent produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that modulates the growth and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus; the corresponding Z isomer is inactive. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite and an antibacterial agent. It is a member of hydroxylamines, a quinolone, an organic heterobicyclic compound and an olefinic compound.
