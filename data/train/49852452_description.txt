The molecule is a doubly-charged organosulfate oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the sulfate OH groups of 6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-[6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->6)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine It is a conjugate base of a 6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-[6-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->6)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine.
