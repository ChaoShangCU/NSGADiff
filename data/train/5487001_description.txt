The molecule is a D-alanyl ester that results from the formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (2R)-lactic acid with the carboxylic acid group of D-alanine. It is a depsipeptide and a D-alanyl ester. It derives from a (R)-lactic acid. It is a tautomer of a D-alanyl-(R)-lactic acid zwitterion.
