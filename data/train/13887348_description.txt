The molecule is a cinnamate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of trans-caffeic acid with one of the hydroxy groups of meso-tartaric acid. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a dicarboxylic acid, a cinnamate ester, a tetraric acid derivative and a member of catechols. It derives from a meso-tartaric acid and a trans-caffeic acid.
