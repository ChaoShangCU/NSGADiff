The molecule is a tetrasaccharide that is beta-lactose in which the hydroxy groups at the 3 and 2' positions have each been glycosylated by an alpha-L-fucosyl group. It is a tetrasaccharide and an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)]-D-Glcp. It derives from a beta-lactose and an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp.
