The molecule is an amino acid betaine that is ergothioneine in which the hydrogen attached to the sulfur is replaced by a methyl group. It has been isolated from the deepwater (500-1,600 m) marine sponge Macandrewia azorica. It has a role as a marine metabolite and an animal metabolite. It is an amino-acid betaine, a member of imidazoles and a methyl sulfide. It derives from an ergothioneine.
