The molecule is a branched amino hexasaccharide in which an alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine linear pentasaccharide carries at the galactose residue proximal to the reducing end a second alpha-L-fucosyl residue via a (1->2) linkage. It is an amino sugar and an amino hexasaccharide.
