The molecule is a labdane diterpenoid that is 7,11,13-labdatrien-16,15-olide substituted by a hydroxy group at position 7 and an oxo group at position 6. Isolated from the rhizomes of Hedychium spicatum, it exhibits cytotoxicity against the Colo-205 (Colo-cancer), A-431 (skin cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), A-549 (lung cancer) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a labdane diterpenoid, a butenolide, an enol, an enone and a member of octahydronaphthalenes.
