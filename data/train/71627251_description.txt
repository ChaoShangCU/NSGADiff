The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-3-oxotetracosatetraenoyl-CoA. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a very long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z)-3-oxotetracosatetraenoyl-CoA.
