The molecule is an N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of propanoic acid with the amino group of L-methionine. It is a L-methionine derivative and a N-(fatty acyl)-L-alpha-amino acid. It derives from a propionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-propanoyl-L-methioninate.
