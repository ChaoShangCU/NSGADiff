The molecule is a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine in which the 1- and 2-acyl groups are specified as hexadecanoyl (palmitoyl) and 9Z-octadecenoyl (oleoyl) respectively. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It derives from a hexadecanoic acid and an oleic acid. It is a tautomer of a 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion.
