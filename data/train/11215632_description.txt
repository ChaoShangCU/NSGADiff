The molecule is a member of the class of polyphenols consisting of a methylcyclohexene ring attached to a 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl and trihydroxyflavanone moieties at positions 5'', 4'' and 3'' respectively (the 2S,3''R,4''R,5''S stereoisomer). Regarded biogenetically as a Diels-Alder adduct, it is isolated from the stem barks of Morus macroura and exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as an antioxidant and a plant metabolite. It is a polyphenol, a trihydroxyflavanone, an aromatic ketone and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones.
