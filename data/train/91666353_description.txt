The molecule is an enoate ester obtained by the formal condensation of the 4'-hydroxy group of luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside with the carboxy group of angelic acid. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, a dihydroxyflavone, a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative and an enoate ester. It derives from a luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside and an angelic acid.
