The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide comprising a linear chain of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-galactose and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, linked (1->3), (1->3) and (1->4) respectively, with an alpha-L-fucose residue linked to the reducing-end N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue.
