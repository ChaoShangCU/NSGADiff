The molecule is a member of the classo of biphenyls that is the amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-methyl-4'-(trifluoromethoxy)[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carboxylic acid with the amino group of 6-(2,6-dimethylmorpholin-4-yl)pyridin-3-amine. Used (as its phosphate salt) for treatment of locally advanced basal cell carcinoma. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a SMO receptor antagonist and a Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor. It is a member of morpholines, an aminopyridine, a member of biphenyls, a member of benzamides, an aromatic ether, an organofluorine compound and a tertiary amino compound.
