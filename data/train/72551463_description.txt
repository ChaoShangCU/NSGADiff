The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (3R,13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-3-hydroxyoctacosapentaenoyl-CoA; major species at pH 7.3. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA(4-), a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (3R,13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-3-hydroxyoctacosapentaenoyl-CoA.
