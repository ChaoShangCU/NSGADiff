The molecule is a epoxydocosatetraenoic acid obtained by formal epoxidation across the 13,14-double bond of (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,16Z,19Z)-13,14-epoxydocosatetraenoate.
