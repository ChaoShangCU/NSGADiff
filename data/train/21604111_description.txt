The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that consists of gypsogenin attached to a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)]-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl] residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Serjania salzmanniana, it exhibits antifungal and molluscicidal activities. It has a role as a molluscicide, an antifungal agent and a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a triterpenoid saponin, a trisaccharide derivative and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a gypsogenin.
