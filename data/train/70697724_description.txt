The molecule is a quassinoid natural product found in Brucea antidysenterica consisting of a heteropentacyclic skeleton containing a delta-lactone moiety which is substituted at the alpha-carbon by a (2E)-3,4-dimethylpent-2-enoyloxy group. It shows significant in vitro cytotoxicity towards several human tumour cell lines. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, an enone, an enoate ester, a delta-lactone, a triol, a cyclic ether, a quassinoid, a methyl ester and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
