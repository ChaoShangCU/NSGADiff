The molecule is a spirostanyl glycoside that is smilagenin attached to a O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->3)]-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Yucca gloriosa and Yucca guatemalensis, it exhibits antifungal activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antifungal agent. It is an organic heterohexacyclic compound, an oxaspiro compound, a spirostanyl glycoside and a trisaccharide derivative. It derives from a (25R)-5beta-spirostan-3beta-ol.
