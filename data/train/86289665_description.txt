The molecule is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (2E,6R)-6-hydroxyhept-2-enoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from a (2E,7R)-7-hydroxyoct-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an ascr#13(1-).
