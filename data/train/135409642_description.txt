The molecule is a carboxylic ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of azilsartan with the hydroxy group of 4-(hydroxymethyl)-5-methyl-1,3-dioxol-2-one. A prodrug for azilsartan, it is used for treatment of hypertension. It has a role as a prodrug, an angiotensin receptor antagonist and an antihypertensive agent. It is a member of benzimidazoles, a dioxolane, a cyclic carbonate ester, a 1,2,4-oxadiazole, an aromatic ether and a carboxylic ester. It derives from an azilsartan.
