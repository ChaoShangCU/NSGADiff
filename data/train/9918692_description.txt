The molecule is a ginsenoside found in Panax species that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions, in which the hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 20 have been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucopyranosides, and in which a double bond has been introduced at the 24-25 position. It has a role as an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a 12beta-hydroxy steroid and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
