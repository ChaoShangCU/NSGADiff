The molecule is a diastereoisomeric mixture of (2S,4R)- and (2S,4S)- hypoglycin A, found in the edible part of the fruit of the Ackee, Blighia sapida (where the 2S,4R diastereoisomer is more dominant (17% d.e.) than its 2S,4S counterpart) as well as in the sycamore maple tree (Acer pseudoplatanus). It has a role as a phytotoxin. It contains a (2S,4S)-hypoglycin A and a (2S,4R)-hypoglycin A.
