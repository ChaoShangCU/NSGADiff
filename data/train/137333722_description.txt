The molecule is a tripeptide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of N(5)-[amino(sulfoamino)phosphoryl]-L-ornithine with the N-terminal amino group of L-alanyl-L-arginine. A toxin produced by cultured Pseudomonas syringae, the causal agent of halo blight disease in bean plants. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and an EC 2.1.3.3 (ornithine carbamoyltransferase) inhibitor. It is a tripeptide and a member of guanidines. It derives from a sulfamic acid.
