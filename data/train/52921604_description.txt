The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide with a structure consisting of an alpha-galactosyl-(1->3)-beta-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetylglucosamine backbone, to the subterminal galactose of which is alpha(1->2)-linked a fucosyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
