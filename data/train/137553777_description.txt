The molecule is an N(2)-acyl-L-glutamine that is L-glutamine in which one of the hydrogens of the alpha-amino group has been replaced by a 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butanoyl group. It is a N(2)-acyl-L-glutamine, a dichlorobenzene and an aromatic ether. It derives from a 2,4-DB. It is a conjugate acid of a N(2)-[4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butanoyl]-L-glutamine(1-).
