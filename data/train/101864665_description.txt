The molecule is an L-isoleucine derivative resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of (+)-12-hydroxy-7-isojasmonic acid with the amino group of L-isoleucine. It has a role as a Brassica napus metabolite. It is a N-acyl-L-alpha-amino acid, a L-isoleucine derivative, a fatty amide, a homoallylic alcohol and a primary alcohol. It derives from a tuberonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-[(+)-12-hydroxy-7-isojasmonyl]-L-isoleucinate.
