The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is biochanin A attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a phytoestrogen and a plant metabolite. It is a hydroxyisoflavone, a member of 4'-methoxyisoflavones and a 7-hydroxyisoflavones 7-O-beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a biochanin A. It is a conjugate acid of a biochanin A 7-O-beta-D-glucoside(1-).
