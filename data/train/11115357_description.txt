The molecule is an organic disulfide that results from the dimerization of (10E,12R)-12-(acetylamino)-N-methyl-N-[(1E)-penta-1,4-dien-1-yl]-13-sulfanyltridec-10-enamide. Isolated from Lyngbya majuscula and Schizothrix, it exhibits antineoplastic acitivity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is an organic disulfide, a member of acetamides, a secondary carboxamide and a tertiary carboxamide.
