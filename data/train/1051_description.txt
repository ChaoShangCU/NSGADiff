The molecule is the monophosphate ester obtained by condensation of phosphoric acid with the primary hydroxy group of pyridoxal. It has a role as a coenzyme, a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a mouse metabolite, an EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-directed DNA polymerase) inhibitor and a cofactor. It is a vitamin B6 phosphate, a member of methylpyridines, a monohydroxypyridine and a pyridinecarbaldehyde. It derives from a pyridoxal. It is a conjugate acid of a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate(2-).
