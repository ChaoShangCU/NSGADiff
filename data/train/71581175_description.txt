The molecule is a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (R)-3-hydroxydodecanoic acid. It is a (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, a 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (R)-3-hydroxylauric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (R)-3-hydroxylauroyl-CoA(4-).
