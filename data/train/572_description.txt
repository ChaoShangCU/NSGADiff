The molecule is propylphosphonic acid in which one of the hydrogens at position 3 is substituted by a formyl(hydroxy)amino group. An antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces lavendulae, it specifically inhibits DXP reductoisomerase (EC 1.1.1.267), a key enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, an EC 1.1.1.267 (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase) inhibitor and a bacterial metabolite. It is a member of phosphonic acids and a hydroxamic acid.
