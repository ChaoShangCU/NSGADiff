The molecule is a pyrimidine nucleoside in which cytosine is attached to D-arabinofuranose via a beta-N(1)-glycosidic bond. Used mainly in the treatment of leukaemia, especially acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, cytarabine is an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent that inhibits the synthesis of DNA. It also has antiviral and immunosuppressant properties. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimetabolite, an antiviral agent and an immunosuppressive agent. It is a beta-D-arabinoside, a pyrimidine nucleoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a cytosine.
