The molecule is a medium-chain unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of trans-2-undecenoic acid. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a trans-undec-2-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-2-undecenoyl-CoA(4-).
