The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (7Z)-3-oxohexadecenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z)-3-oxohexadecenoyl-CoA(4-).
