The molecule is a triply-charged organophosphate oxoanion arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid and phosphate OH groups of (2S)-2-amino-3-oxo-4-(phosphonooxy)butanoic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is an organophosphate oxoanion and an alpha-amino-acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a (2S)-2-amino-3-oxo-4-(phosphonooxy)butanoic acid and a (2S)-2-ammonio-3-oxo-4-(phosphonatooxy)butanoate(2-).
