The molecule is a pyrazole pesticide that is 1,3-dimethylpyrazol-5-ol in thich the hydrogen at position 4 has been replaced by a 2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl group. A 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor, it is used as a herbicide (particularly in conjunction with the safener mefenpyr-diethyl) to control various broad-leaved weeds. It has a role as a herbicide, a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.27 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitor and an agrochemical. It is a pyrazole pesticide, an aromatic ketone, a sulfone and a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes.
