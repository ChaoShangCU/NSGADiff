The molecule is a spirostanyl glycoside that is smilagenin attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Yucca gloriosa and Yucca guatemalensis, it exhibits antifungal activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antifungal agent. It is a spirostanyl glycoside, a disaccharide derivative, an organic heterohexacyclic compound and an oxaspiro compound. It derives from a (25R)-5beta-spirostan-3beta-ol.
