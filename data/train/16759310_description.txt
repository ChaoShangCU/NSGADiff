The molecule is an N-acyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid resulting from the formal condensation of the amino group of gamma-aminobutyric acid with the carboxy group of arachidonic acid. It has a role as a mammalian metabolite. It is a fatty amide and a N-acyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid. It derives from an arachidonic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-arachidonoyl-gamma-aminobutyrate.
