The molecule is a polyketide that is (all-E)-7-(3-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)hepta-2,4,6-trienoic acid in which the amino group has been acylated by an (all-E)-7-cyclohexylhepta-2,4,6-trienoyl group and in which the carboxy group has undergone formal condensation with the amino group of 2-amino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-en-1-one to give the corresponding carboxamide. Protoasukamycin is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of asukamycin. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is an enamide, a polyketide, a member of phenols, a cyclic ketone, an enol, an enone and a secondary carboxamide.
