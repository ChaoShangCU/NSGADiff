The molecule is a branched amino heptasaccharide comprising N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine, beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine, alpha-D-galactose, beta-D-galactose and D-glucose residues linked sequentially (1->3), (1->3), (1->3), (1->4) and (1->4), to the beta-D-galactose residue nearest to the non-reducing end is also linked (1->2) an alpha-L-fucose residue. It is an amino heptasaccharide and a galactosamine oligosaccharide.
