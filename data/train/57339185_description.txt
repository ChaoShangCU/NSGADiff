The molecule is an acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of [(1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-en-1-yl]acetic acid. It derives from a [(R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-en-1-yl]acetic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a [(1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl]acetyl-CoA(4-).
