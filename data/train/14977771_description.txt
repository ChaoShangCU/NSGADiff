The molecule is a pyrazolopyrazole that is 6,7-dihydro-1H,5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid which has been substituted at positions 2, 5 and 6 by methylsulfonyl, oxo, and amino groups, respectively, and in which the amino group has been condensed with the carboxy group of (2-amino-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)(oxo)acetic acid, the oxo group of which has been converted to the corresponding oxime O-allyl ether. It is a pyrazolopyrazole, an oxime O-ether, a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a sulfone, an amino acid and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
