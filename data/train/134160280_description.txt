The molecule is a branched trisaccharide derivative consisting of a disaccharide unit of beta-D-glucose and N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine residues linked (1->3), to the N-acetylgalactosamine residue of which is also linked (1->4) an alpha-L-rhamnosyl residue, the whole linked glycosidically to a 5-aminopentyl group. It is a trisaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
