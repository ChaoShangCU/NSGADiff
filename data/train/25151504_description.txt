The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2S)-2-({[(2-isopropyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)methyl](methyl)carbamoyl}amino)-4-(morpholin-4-yl)butanoic acid with the amino group of 1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl [(2R,5R)-5-amino-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate. Acts as a pharmacoenhancer in treatment of HIV-1 by inhibiting P450 enzymes that metabolise other medications.. It has a role as a P450 inhibitor. It is a member of 1,3-thiazoles, a member of morpholines, a member of ureas, a carbamate ester and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
