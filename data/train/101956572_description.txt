The molecule is a glycoside formed between the branched tetrasaccharide alpha-L-Fuc-(1->2)-[alpha-D-Gal-(1->3)]-beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-alpha-D-GalNAc and the alkenyl alcohol oct-7-en-1-ol. It contains an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->2)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1->3)]-beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-yl group. It derives from an oct-7-en-1-ol.
