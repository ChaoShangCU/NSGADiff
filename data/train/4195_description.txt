The molecule is an aromatic ether that is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene which is substituted at position 2 by a 2-(glycylamino)-1-hydroxyethyl group. A direct-acting sympathomimetic with selective alpha-adrenergic agonist activity, it is used (generally as its hydrochloride salt) as a peripheral vasoconstrictor in the treatment of certain hypotensive states. The main active moiety is its major metabolite, deglymidodrine. It has a role as a prodrug, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sympathomimetic agent and a vasoconstrictor agent. It is a secondary alcohol, an amino acid amide and an aromatic ether. It derives from a glycinamide and a deglymidodrine. It is a conjugate base of a midodrine(1+).
