The molecule is an amino cyclitol that is (1R,2S,3S,4S,6R)-4-amino-6-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane-1,2,3-triol in which one of the hydrogens attached to the nitrogen is replaced by a (1R,4R,5R,6S)-4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohex-2-en-1-yl group. It has a role as an EC 3.2.1.28 (alpha,alpha-trehalase) inhibitor, a bacterial metabolite, an antibiotic insecticide and an animal metabolite. It is an amino cyclitol and a secondary amino compound. It derives from a validamine. It is a conjugate base of a validoxylamine A(1+).
