The molecule is a triterpene glycoside that is lanost-8-ene substituted by a methylidene group at position 24 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 3. Isolated from the whole plant of Silybum marianum, it exhibits inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin. It has a role as an EC 3.4.21.1 (chymotrypsin) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin.
