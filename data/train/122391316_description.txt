The molecule is a docosanoid that is (4Z,7Z,11E,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid carrying a hydroperoxy substituent at position 10. It is a docosanoid, a hydroperoxy fatty acid and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (4Z,7Z,11E,13Z,16Z,19Z)-10-hydroperoxydocosahexaenoate.
