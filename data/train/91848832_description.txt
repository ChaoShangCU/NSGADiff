The molecule is an amino trisaccharide that is D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy groups at posiitons 2 and 6 have been converted into the corresponding 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl derivatives. It is an amino trisaccharide, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-Galp.
