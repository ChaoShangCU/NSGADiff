The molecule is a member of the class of rotenones that consists of 1,2,12,12a-tetrahydrochromeno[3,4-b]furo[2,3-h]chromen-6(6aH)-one substituted at position 2 by a prop-1-en-2-yl group and at positions 8 and 9 by methoxy groups (the 2R,6aS,12aS-isomer). A non-systemic insecticide, it is the principal insecticidal constituent of derris (the dried rhizome and root of Derris elliptica). It has a role as a phytogenic insecticide, a mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone reductase inhibitor, a metabolite, an antineoplastic agent and a toxin. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a member of rotenones.
