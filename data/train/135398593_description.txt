The molecule is a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside that is inosine in which the hydroxy group at position 2' is replaced by a hydrogen. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a human metabolite, a plant metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a purines 2'-deoxy-D-ribonucleoside and a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside. It derives from an inosine.
