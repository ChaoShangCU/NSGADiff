The molecule is an N-acyl-(2S)-hydroxyglycine resulting from the formal condensation of (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acid with the amino group of (2S)-hydroxyglycine. It derives from an alpha-linolenic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N-(9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoyl-(2S)-hydroxyglycinate.
