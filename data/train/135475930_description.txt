The molecule is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide that is guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in which the hydrogen at position 8 on the purine fragment has been replaced by a nitro group. It has a role as a Brassica napus metabolite, a signalling molecule, a biomarker and a human metabolite. It is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide and a C-nitro compound. It derives from a 3',5'-cyclic GMP. It is a conjugate acid of an 8-nitroguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate(1-).
