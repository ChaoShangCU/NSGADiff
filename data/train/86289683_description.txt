The molecule is the 2-aminoethyl glycoside of an amino decasaccharide made of two alpha-L-Rhap-(1->2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-[alpha-D-Glcp-(1->4)]-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc repeating units of the Shigella flexneri serotype 2a specific polysaccharide linked (1->2) and with the rhamnose residue four residues from the reducing end acetylated on O-3.
