The molecule is a tetracyclic triterpenoid that is 25,26,27-trinorlanost-8-en-24-oic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 7 and oxo groups at positions 11 and 15 respectively (the 3beta,5alpha,7beta stereoisomer). Isolated from the fruiting bodies of Ganoderma lucidum, it exhibits cytotoxicity against tumour cells. It has a role as a metabolite, an EC 3.1.1.8 (cholinesterase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a cyclic terpene ketone, a dioxo monocarboxylic acid and a secondary alcohol.
