The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl, beta-D-mannopyranosyl and 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues joined in sequence by (1->2) and (1->4) glycosidic bonds. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Manp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc and a beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-Manp.
