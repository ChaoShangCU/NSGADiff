The molecule is a papulacandin that is papulacandin A in which the (2E,4E)-deca-2,4-dienoyl chain at the O-(6') position is replaced by a (2E,4Z,6E)-8-hydroxydeca-2,4,6-trienoyl chain. It is the major carbohydrate-containing antibiotic from the deuteromycetous fungus Papularia sphaerosperma which shows potent antifungal activity against Candida albicans. It has a role as an antifungal agent and a metabolite. It is a disaccharide derivative, a papulacandin and an organic heterotricyclic compound. It derives from an alpha-lactose.
