The molecule is a tetrasaccharide derivative with a dimeric structure in which two 2-O-[N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl]-D-glyceric acid units are linked via a phosphodiester bridge, the reducing-end GlcNAc residue also being connected at O-6 to a 5-aminopentyl linker via a further phosphodiester linkage. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative and a carbohydrate phosphate. It derives from a D-glyceric acid.
