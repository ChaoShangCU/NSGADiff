The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-octacosapentaenoyl-CoA. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), a very long-chain acyl-CoA(4-) and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-octacosapentaenoyl-CoA.
