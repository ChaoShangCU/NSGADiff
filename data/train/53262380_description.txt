The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of the trisaccharide beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galctose where the galactosyl residue at the non-reducing end has alpha-L-fucosyl and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl residues attached at the 2- and 3-positions respectively. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
