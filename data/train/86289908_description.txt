The molecule is an avermectin analogue that is avermectin A1a in which the methoxy group attached to the tetrahydrobenzofuranyl moiety is replaced by a hydroxy group and in which the hydroxy group at position 4 of the terminal 2,6-dideoxy-3-O-methyl-alpha-L-arabino-hyxopoyranosyl group is replaced by an acetamido group. It is an avermectin analogue, a semisynthetic derivative, a member of acetamides, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a spiroketal and a disaccharide derivative.
