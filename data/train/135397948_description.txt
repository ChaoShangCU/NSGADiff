The molecule is a 3beta-hydroxy-4beta-formyl-4alpha-methylsteroid resulting from the formal oxidation of the 4beta-hydroxymethyl group of 4beta-hydroxymethyl-4alpha-methyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol to the corresponding formyl group. It derives from a 4beta-hydroxymethyl-4alpha-methyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol.
