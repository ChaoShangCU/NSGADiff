The molecule is an oligosaccharide phosphate consisting of four alpha(1->3)-linked D-mannose residues, with the residue at the non-reducing end carrying a phosphate group at position 6, and with that at the reducing end being alpha(1->2)-linked to a further D-mannose residue; prepared from the phosphomannan fraction of Hansenula holstii. It has a role as an epitope.
