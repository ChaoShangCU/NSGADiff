The molecule is an extended flavonoid that consists of (2S)-flavanone substituted methoxy groups at positions 3' and 4', a prenyl group at position 6 and a gem-dimethylpyran ring fused across positions 7 and 8. Isolated from Lonchocarpus utilis and Lonchocarpus urucu, it acts as a NADH:ubiquinone reductase inhibitor. It has a role as an EC 1.6.5.3 [NADH:ubiquinone reductase (H(+)-translocating)] inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a dimethoxyflavanone, an extended flavonoid, a pyranochromane, a member of 4'-methoxyflavanones and a member of 3'-methoxyflavanones.
