The molecule is a member of the class of phenylureas that is urea in which one of the amino groups has been substituted by a 5-tert-butyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl group while the other has been substituted by a phenyl group substituted at the para- position by an imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl group that, in turn, is substituted at position 7 by a 2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethoxy group. It has a role as an EC 2.7.10.1 (receptor protein-tyrosine kinase) inhibitor and an antineoplastic agent. It is a benzoimidazothiazole, a member of morpholines, a member of isoxazoles and a member of phenylureas.
