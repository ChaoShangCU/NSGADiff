The molecule is a leukotriene that is (7E,9E,11Z,14Z)-icosa-7,9,11,14-tetraenoic acid substituted by a hydroxy group at position 5 (5S) and an N-acetyl-L-cystein-S-yl group at position 6 (6R); it is a major bilary metabolite of cysteinyl leukotrienes. It has a role as a human urinary metabolite. It derives from a leukotriene E4.
