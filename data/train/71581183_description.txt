The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-octacosapentaenoic acid. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and an ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-octacosapentaenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (13Z,16Z,19Z,22Z,25Z)-octacosapentaenoyl-CoA(4-).
