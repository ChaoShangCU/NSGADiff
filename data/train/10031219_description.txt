The molecule is an isoquinoline alkaloid that is a dimer of 8-methoxydehydroanonaine. Isolated from the roots of Polyalthia debilis, it exhibits moderate antimalarial activity by inhibiting the growth of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. It has a role as a metabolite and an antimalarial. It is an isoquinoline alkaloid, an aromatic ether, an oxacycle, a biaryl, a member of isoquinolines and a ring assembly. It derives from a (-)-annonaine.
