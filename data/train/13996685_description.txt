The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is cycloastragenol glycosylated at positions 3 and 6 by 2,3-di-O-acetyl-beta-D-xylosyl and beta-D-glucosyl residues respectively. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a triterpenoid saponin, a monosaccharide derivative, a beta-D-glucoside, a member of oxolanes and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a cycloastragenol.
