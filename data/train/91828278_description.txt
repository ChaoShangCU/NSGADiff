The molecule is a 3-hydroxyicosanoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (3S)-hydroxyicosanoic acid. It is a 3-hydroxyicosanoyl-CoA and a long-chain (3S)-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a (3S)-3-hydroxyicosanoyl-CoA(4-).
