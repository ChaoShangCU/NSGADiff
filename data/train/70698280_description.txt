The molecule is a flavone C-glycoside that is luteolin substituted by a 6-deoxy-2-O-(6-deoxy-alpha-L-mannopyranosyl)-beta-L-ribo-hexopyranos-3-ulosyll residue at position 6. It has been found in Petrorhagia velutina and Cassia occidentalis. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a flavone C-glycoside, a tetrahydroxyflavone, a disaccharide derivative and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a luteolin.
