The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (8Z,11Z,14Z)-3-oxoicosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid. It is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of an (8Z,11Z,14Z)-3-oxoicosa-8,11,14-trienoyl-CoA(4-).
