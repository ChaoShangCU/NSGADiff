The molecule is a steroid glucosiduronic acid that is 16alpha-hydroxyestrone in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 16 has been replaced by a beta-D-glucuronyl residue. It is a steroid glucosiduronic acid, a 17-oxo steroid, a 3-hydroxy steroid, a member of phenols and a beta-D-glucosiduronic acid. It derives from a 16alpha-hydroxyestrone. It is a conjugate acid of a 16alpha-hydroxyestrone 16-O-(beta-D-glucuronide)(1-).
