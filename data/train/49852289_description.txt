The molecule is an N-acyl-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate in which the phosphate group of 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxyglucose 1-phosphate is esterified by the alcoholic hydroxy group of L-serine. It is a N-acyl-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate, an O-phosphoamino acid and a L-serine derivative. It is a conjugate acid of an O-(N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphonatooxy)-L-serine(1-).
