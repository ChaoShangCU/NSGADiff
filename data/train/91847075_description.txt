The molecule is a linear amino trisaccharide consisting of an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue linked (1->6) to a beta-D-galactose residue which is itself linked (1->4) to another N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residue at the reducing end. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino trisaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
