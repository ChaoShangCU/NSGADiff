The molecule is an O-acyl carbohydrate obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of indole-3-carboxylic acid with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucuronic acid. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a glucosiduronic acid, an O-acyl carbohydrate and an indolyl carbohydrate. It derives from a beta-D-glucuronic acid and an indole-3-carboxylic acid.
