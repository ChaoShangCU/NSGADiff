The molecule is a pyrroline that is 1-pyrroline in which the hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by an acetyl group. It is an aroma and flavour compound present in jasmine rice and basmati rice. It is responsible for the 'popcorn' aroma in a large variety of cereal and food products. It is one of the key odourants of the crust of bread and considered to be responsible for the cracker-like odour properties. In bread, it is primarily generated during baking but amounts are influenced by ingredient composition and fermentation conditions. It has a role as a metabolite, a flavouring agent and a Maillard reaction product. It is a methyl ketone, a pyrroline and an acylimine.
