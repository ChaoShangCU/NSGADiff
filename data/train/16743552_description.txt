The molecule is an O-acyl carbohydrate obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucose. It has a role as an Arabidopsis thaliana metabolite. It is an O-acyl carbohydrate, a beta-D-glucoside and a member of oxindoles. It derives from a 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid.
