The molecule is a sulfonamide resulting from the formal condensation of the sulfonic acid group of 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-6-sulfonic acid with the primary amino group of (2R)-2-amino-N-(2-furylmethyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-N-(2-thienylmethyl)acetamide. OSMI-1 is a cell permeable inhibitor of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (O-GlcNAc transferase, OGT). It has a role as an EC 2.* (transferase) inhibitor and an EC 2.4.1.255 (protein O-GlcNAc transferase) inhibitor. It is a sulfonamide, a member of quinolines, a member of furans, a member of thiophenes, an aromatic ether and a tertiary carboxamide.
