The molecule is a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (11Z)-eicosenoyl-CoA. It is a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an (11Z)-Delta(11)-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of an (11Z)-eicosenoyl-CoA.
