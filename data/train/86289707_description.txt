The molecule is an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside obtained by formal condensation of the alcoholic hydroxy group of (19R)-19-hydroxyicosanoic acid with ascarylopyranose (the alpha anomer). It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a monocarboxylic acid and an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside. It derives from a (19R)-19-hydroxyicosanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an ascr#36(1-).
