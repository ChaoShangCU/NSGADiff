The molecule is a medium-chain unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of cis,cis-dodeca-3,6-dienoic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a cis,cis-dodeca-3,6-dienoic acid and a coenzyme A. It is a conjugate acid of a (3Z,6Z)-dodecadienoyl-CoA(4-).
