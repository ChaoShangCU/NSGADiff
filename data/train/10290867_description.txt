The molecule is a member of the class of hydroxypiperidines that is piperidine carrying a hydroxymethyl substituent at position 2 as well as two hydroxy substituents at positions 3 and 4 (the 2R,3R,4S-diastereomer). It has a role as an EC 3.2.1.10 (oligo-1,6-glucosidase) inhibitor, a plant metabolite and an EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-galactosidase) inhibitor. It is a hydroxypiperidine, a triol, a primary alcohol, a secondary alcohol, a secondary amino compound and an amino monosaccharide.
