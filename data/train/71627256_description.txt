The molecule is a mannooligosaccharide derivative consisting of a chain of three D-mannose residues linked sequentially alpha(1->2) and alpha(1->3), with an alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl unit linked (1->6) to the mannose residue at the reducing end, this reducing-end residue also being beta-linked to a 5-aminopentyl group.
