The molecule is a 2-enoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the enoic carboxy group of hex-2-enedioic acid. It is a 2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 2-hexenedioic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 2,3-didehydroadipoyl-CoA(5-).
