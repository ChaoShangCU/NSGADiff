The molecule is a cardenolide glycoside that is tanghinigenin attached to a 2-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-3-O-methyl-alpha-L-glucopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidc linkage. Isolated from Cerbera manghas, it exhibits cytotoxic activities against oral human epidermoid carcinoma (KB), human breast cancer cell (BC) and human small cells lung cancer. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cardenolide glycoside, an acetate ester, a monosaccharide derivative, a tertiary alcohol and an epoxide. It derives from a tanghinigenin.
