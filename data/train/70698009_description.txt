The molecule is a quercetin O-glucoside that is the decaacetate ester derivative of petiolaroside. Isolated from the aerial parts of Delphinium staphisagria, it exhibits trypanocidal activity. It has a role as a metabolite, a trypanocidal drug and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an acetate ester and a quercetin O-glucoside. It derives from an alpha-L-rhamnopyranose and a petiolaroside.
