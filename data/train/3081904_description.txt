The molecule is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is the diester obtained by the condensation of the hydroxy groups of 2alpha-hydroxymaprounic acid with p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Isolated from Maprounea africana, it exhibits inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It has a role as a metabolite and a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is a benzoate ester and a pentacyclic triterpenoid. It derives from a 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and a maprounic acid.
