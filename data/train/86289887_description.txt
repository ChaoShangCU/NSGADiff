The molecule is a 4-O-(1H-indol-3-ylcarbonyl)ascaroside that is icas#10 in which the pro-R hydrogen beta to the carboxy group is replaced by a hydroxy group. It is a metabolite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It has a role as a Caenorhabditis elegans metabolite. It is a 4-O-(1H-indol-3-ylcarbonyl)ascaroside, an (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acid ascaroside, a 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid and a monocarboxylic acid. It derives from a bhas#10, a (3R,8R)-3,8-dihydroxynonanoic acid and an icas#10.
