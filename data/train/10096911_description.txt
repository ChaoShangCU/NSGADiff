The molecule is a member of the class of chalcones that consists of trans-chalcone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 4 and 2', a prenyl group at position 3' and a beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy group at position 4'. Isolated from the stem barks of Maclura tinctoria, it exhibits antioxidant activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antioxidant. It is a member of chalcones, a polyphenol, a beta-D-glucoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a trans-chalcone.
