The molecule is a metallochlorin that is ferroheme b which is hydroxylated at positions 5 and 6, and in which the resulting 6-hydroxy group undergoes formal condensation with the carboxy group of the 6-carboxyethyl group to afford the corresponding spirolactone in which the oxygen atoms at positions 5 and 6 are trans to each other. It is a gamma-lactone, an azaspiro compound, a ferroheme, a metallochlorin, a monocarboxylic acid, an oxaspiro compound and a tertiary alcohol. It is a conjugate acid of a trans-heme d hydroxychlorin gamma-spirolactone(1-).
