The molecule is an aminoalkylpyridine that is pyridine substituted by a 2-(methylamino)ethyl group at position 2. It acts as a histamine agonist and a vasodilator, and is thought to improve the microcirculation of the labyrinth, resulting in reduced endolymphatic pressure. It is used (generally as the hydrochloride or mesylate salt) to reduce the symptoms of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss associated with Meniere's disease. It has a role as a vasodilator agent and a H1-receptor agonist. It is an aminoalkylpyridine and a secondary amino compound.
