The molecule is an iridoid monoterpenoid that is hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]furan substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 1 and 3a, a 3-oxopropen-2yl group at position 6 and a trans-4-coumaroyloxy moiety at position 4 (the 1S,3aS,4S,6S,6aS stereoisomer). Isolated from the leaves of Viburnum luzonicum, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a cinnamate ester, an aldehyde, a cyclic ether, a secondary alcohol, a member of phenols, an iridoid monoterpenoid, a tertiary alcohol and an organic heterobicyclic compound. It derives from a trans-4-coumaric acid.
