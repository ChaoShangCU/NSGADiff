The molecule is an L-alanine derivative obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of fumaric acid monoamide with the side-chain amino group of 3-amino-L-alanine. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is an enamide, a L-alanine derivative, a primary carboxamide and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a 3-amino-L-alanine and a fumaric acid. It is a tautomer of a N(3)-fumaramoyl-(S)-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid zwitterion.
