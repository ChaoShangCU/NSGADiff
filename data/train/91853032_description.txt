The molecule is an amino disaccharide comprising a beta-D-mannosyl residue linked (1->3) to an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue at the reducing end. It is an amino disaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide, a glycosylglucose derivative and a member of acetamides. It derives from a N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine and an alpha-D-mannose.
