The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) obtained by deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosatrienoyl-CoA. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an (11Z)-Delta(11)-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a 3-substituted propionyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of an all-cis-icosa-8,11,14-trienoyl-CoA.
