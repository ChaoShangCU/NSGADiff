The molecule is a glycine derivative that is the amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of N-(2,5-dichlorobenzoyl)glycine with the amino group of 2,2'-{2-[(1R)-1-amino-3-methylbutyl]-5-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaborolane-4,4-diyl}diacetic acid. A prodrug for ixazomib that is used in combination therapy for treatment of multiple myeloma. It has a role as a prodrug, a proteasome inhibitor, an orphan drug, an antineoplastic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a glycine derivative, a member of benzamides, a dichlorobenzene, an oxo dicarboxylic acid and a 1,3,2-dioxaborolane. It derives from an ixazomib.
