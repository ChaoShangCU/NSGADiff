The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-3-O-[(R)-lactoyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-3-O-[(R)-lactoyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl, and 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranosyl residues joined together in sequence by (1->4) glycosidic linkages. NB The SNFG depiction of this compound by GlyTouCan depicts N-acetylmuramic acid groups instead of the 2-acetamido-3-O-[(R)-lactoyl]-beta-D-glucopyranosyl groups shown in both the SID (submitted by GlyTouCan) and CID entries in PubChem. It is not clear which compound is intended. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides.
