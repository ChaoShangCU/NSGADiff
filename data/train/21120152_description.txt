The molecule is an O-glycosyl amino acid that is L-lysine in which one of the methylene hydrogens at position 5 has been replaced by an (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)oxy group. It has a role as a marine metabolite. It is an O-glycosyl amino acid, a L-lysine derivative and a glycosylgalactose derivative. It derives from an alpha-D-Glcp-(1->2)-beta-D-Galp.
