The molecule is a hydroxamic acid that is N-hydroxy-D-valinamide in which the alpha-amino group has been substituted by isopropoxy and [biphenyl]-4-ylsulfonyl groups. A selective matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) inhibitor, it is one of the most potent inducers of autophagy. Its physiological roles include angiogenesis, cancer metastasis, embryogenesis, tissue remodeling in development, and wound healing. It has a role as an EC 3.4.24.24 (gelatinase A) inhibitor, an autophagy inducer, an antineoplastic agent and a melanin synthesis inhibitor. It is a hydroxamic acid and a D-valine derivative.
