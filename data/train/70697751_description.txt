The molecule is a spirostanyl glycoside that is pennogenin attached to a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from the stem bark of Dracaena mannii, it exhibits anti-inflammatory activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an anti-inflammatory agent. It is a spirostanyl glycoside, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid, a beta-D-glucoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a pennogenin.
