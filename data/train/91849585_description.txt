The molecule is a branched decasaccharide comprising six D-arabinofuranose and four mannopyranose units, in an assembly consisting of two arabinose residues linked alpha(1->5), with alpha-mannosyl-(1->2)-alpha-mannosyl-(1->5)-alpha-arabinosyl-(1->2)-alpha-arabinosyl tetrasaccharide units linked to the 3- and 5-positions of the residue distal from the reducing-end residue.
