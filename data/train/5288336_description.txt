The molecule is a branched tetrasaccharide consisting of alpha-D-galactose, alpha-D-mannose and alpha-L-rhamnose residues linked sequentially (1->2) and (1->4), to the mannose residue of which is also linked (1->3) an alpha-D-abequose residue. The structure constitutes a possible epitope of the O-antigen polysaccharide in Salmonella. It has a role as an epitope.
