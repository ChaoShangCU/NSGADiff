The molecule is a member of the class of benzamides resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of the pyridin-3-ylmethyl carbamate derivative of p-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid with one of the amino groups of benzene-1,2-diamine. It is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase isoform 1 (HDAC1) and isoform 3 (HDAC3). It has a role as an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a member of pyridines, a carbamate ester, a substituted aniline, a primary amino compound and a member of benzamides. It derives from a 1,2-phenylenediamine.
