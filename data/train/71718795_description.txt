The molecule is a viscumneoside that is viscumneoside III in which the primary hydroxy group of the beta-D-apiofuranosyl moiety has itself been converted to the corresponding beta-D-apiofuranoside derivative. Found in Viscum coloratum, an evergreen hemiparasitic plant whose stems and leaves are used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatism. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a viscumneoside, a flavanone glycoside and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a viscumneoside III, a homoeriodictyol and a beta-D-apiose.
