The molecule is a triazaacenaphthylene that is 2,2a,3,4,5,5a,6,7-octahydro-1H-1,8,8b-triazaacenaphthylene which is substituted at positions 3, 4, and 7 by methyl, sulfooxy, and (2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-4-yl)methyl groups, respectively (the 2aS,3R,4S,5aS,7R stereoisomer). A non-toxic analogue of the cyanotoxins cylindrospermopsin and 7-epi-cylindrospermopsin (the latter two have a hydroxy group attached to the carbon adjacent to the uracil ring), it is produced by several species of freshwater cyanobacteria, such as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. It has a role as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It is an alkaloid, a member of cylindrospermopsins, an organic sulfate, a pyrimidone and a triazaacenaphthylene. It is a tautomer of a deoxycylindrospermopsin zwitterion.
