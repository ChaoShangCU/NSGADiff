The molecule is a sesquiterpene alkaloid that is a macrolide incorporating a substituted dihydroagarofuran and a pyrindine ring. Isolated from Maytenus emarginata, it exhibits cytotoxicity against human KB cells. It has a role as a metabolite and an antineoplastic agent. It is a sesquiterpene alkaloid, a member of methylpyridines, a pyridone, a macrolide, an acetate ester, a benzoate ester, a dihydroagarofuran sesquiterpenoid and a pyridine alkaloid. It derives from an evonine.
