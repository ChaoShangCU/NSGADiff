The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoester resulting from the formal condensation of one of the carboxylic acid groups of crocetin with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-glucopyranose. It is a dicarboxylic acid monoester and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a crocetin and a beta-D-glucose. It is a conjugate acid of a beta-D-glucosyl crocetin(1-).
