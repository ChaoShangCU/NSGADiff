The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is the 2, 3-epoxy derivative of zerumbone. Isolated from Zingiber zerumbet, it exhibits inhibitory activity against nitric oxide synthase. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a sesquiterpenoid, a cyclic ketone, an enone and an epoxide. It derives from a zerumbone. It derives from a hydride of an alpha-humulene.
