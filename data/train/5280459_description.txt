The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that is quercetin substituted by a alpha-L-rhamnosyl moiety at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as an antioxidant, an antileishmanial agent, an EC 1.1.1.184 [carbonyl reductase (NADPH)] inhibitor, an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor, an EC 1.14.18.1 (tyrosinase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a monosaccharide derivative, a tetrahydroxyflavone, an alpha-L-rhamnoside and a quercetin O-glycoside. It is a conjugate acid of a quercitrin-7-olate.
