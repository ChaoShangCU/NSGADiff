The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is (+)-endo-beta-bergamotene in which one of the methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond in the side-chain has been oxidised to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. It has a role as an insecticide and a plant metabolite. It is an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, a bridged compound and a sesquiterpenoid. It derives from a hydride of a (+)-endo-beta-bergamotene.
