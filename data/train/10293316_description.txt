The molecule is an amino disaccharide that is D-galactopyranose in which the hydroxy group at position 6 has been converted to the corresponding 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside. It is a N-acyl-hexosamine, an amino disaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a D-galactopyranose and a N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine.
