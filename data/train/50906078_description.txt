The molecule is a flavone C-glycoside that is luteolin substituted by a 2-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1''->2')]-beta-D-xylopyranosyl residue at positon 6. It has been isolated from the leaves and roots of Petrorhagia velutina. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a disaccharide derivative, a flavone C-glycoside and a tetrahydroxyflavone. It derives from a luteolin.
