The molecule is an indolecarboxamide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 6-chloro-3-[(dimethylamino)(oxo)acetyl]-1-methylindole-5-carboxylic acid with the secondary amino group of (2S,5R)-1-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-2,5-dimethylpiperazine. It is a potent inhibitor of MAPK and exhibits anti-cancer properties. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.24 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a N-acylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, an aromatic amide, a member of monofluorobenzenes, a chloroindole, an indolecarboxamide, a dicarboxylic acid diamide and an aromatic ketone.
