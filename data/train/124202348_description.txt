The molecule is a leukotriene that is (5S,7E,9E,14Z)-5-hydroxy-12-oxoicosa-7,9,14-trienoic acid to which a glutathionyl group is attached at position 6 via a sulfide linkage. It is a leukotriene, a glutathione derivative, an organic sulfide, a tricarboxylic acid, a ketone and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a leukotriene C4. It is a conjugate acid of an 11,12-dihydro-12-oxoleukotriene C4(2-).
