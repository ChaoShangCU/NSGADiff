The molecule is a flavonol 7-O-beta-D-glucoside that is quercetin substituted by a p-hydroxybenzyl group at position 6 and a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It is isolated from the root barks of Cudrania tricuspidata and exhibits radical scavenging effects against 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and anti-lipid peroxidation efficacy on human low-density lipoprotein by TBARS assay. It has a role as a metabolite and a radical scavenger. It is a flavonol 7-O-beta-D-glucoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a quercetin.
