The molecule is an N-alkylpiperazine that is 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine carrying a 3,3-diphenyl-2-hydroxyprop-1-yl group at position 4. A selective h5-HT1D antagonist, displaying 60-fold selectivity over h5-HT1B, and exhibiting little or no affinity for a range of other receptor types. It has a role as a serotonergic antagonist. It is a N-alkylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine, a secondary alcohol and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It is a conjugate base of a 4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-(2-hydroxy-3,3-diphenylpropyl)piperazin-1-ium(1+).
