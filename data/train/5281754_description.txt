The molecule is a but-2-enoate ester obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of (2E)-2-methylbut-2-enoic acid with the 1-hydroxy group of (1R,7aR)-7-({[(2S,3S)-2,3-dihydroxy-2-isopropylbutanoyl]oxy}methyl)-2,3,5,7a-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizin-1-ol. It is a but-2-enoate ester and a member of pyrrolizines.
