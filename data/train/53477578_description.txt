The molecule is a dipeptide that consists of two piperidine-4-carboxylic acid units (connected via amide linkages) where the amino terminus is acylated by a 3-[2-(2-{[4-(indol-3-yl)butanoyl]amino}ethoxy)ethoxy]propanoyl group and the carboxy terminus is formally condensed with the amino group of 3-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]propanoic acid, the carboxy group of which is in turn formally condensed with the alpha-amino group of N(6)-5-nitrofuroyllysine. It is a C-nitro compound, a member of furans, a member of indoles, a polyether and a dipeptide.
