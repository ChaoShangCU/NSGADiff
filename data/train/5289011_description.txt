The molecule is a branched amino pentasaccharide consisting of the linear trisaccharide N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine having alpha-L-fucosyl residues attached at position 2 of the galactose and position 3 of the glucosamine. Corresponds to a partial structure of blood group A type 2 oligosaccharide. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino pentasaccharide, a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
