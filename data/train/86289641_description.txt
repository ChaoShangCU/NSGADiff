The molecule is a polysaccharide derivative comprised of a [2)-alpha-L-Rhap(III)-(1->2)-alpha-L-Rhap(II)-(1->3)-alpha-L-Rhap(I)-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->] tetrasaccharide repeat modified by the (1->4) linkage of an alpha-D-glucosyl group to the Rha(I) residue and by addition of an acetyl group to 50% of the O-6 positions of the GlcNAc residue. The structure provided is representative of that in Shigella flexneri serotype 2a and shows the repeating unit containing the acetyl group on the GlcNAc residue. It has a role as an antigen.
