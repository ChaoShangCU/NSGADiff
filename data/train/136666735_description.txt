The molecule is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride that results from the formal condensation of the phosphoryl group of GMP with the carboxyl group of lipoic acid. It has a role as a mammalian metabolite. It is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride, a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate and a member of dithiolanes. It derives from a (R)-lipoic acid and a guanosine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a (R)-lipoyl-GMP(1-).
