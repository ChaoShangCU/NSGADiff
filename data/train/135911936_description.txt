The molecule is a organic phosphoramidate that is guanosine 5'-monophosphate in which one of the hydroxy groups of the phosphate has been condensed with the side chain amino group of N(alpha)-acetyl-L-lysine methyl ester. It is a L-lysine derivative, an organic phosphoramidate, a member of acetamides and a methyl ester. It derives from a guanosine 5'-monophosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a N(epsilon)-(5'-guanylyl)-N(alpha)-acetyl-L-lysine methyl ester(1-).
