The molecule is ergotamine in which a single bond replaces the double bond between positions 9 and 10. A semisynthetic ergot alkaloid with weaker oxytocic and vasoconstrictor properties than ergotamine, it is used (as the methanesulfonic or tartaric acid salts) for the treatment of migraine and orthostatic hypotension. It has a role as a serotonergic agonist, a non-narcotic analgesic, a vasoconstrictor agent, a dopamine agonist and a sympatholytic agent. It is an ergot alkaloid and a semisynthetic derivative.
