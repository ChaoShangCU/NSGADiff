The molecule is an N-sulfonylurea that is 3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazole-1-carboxamide in which the carboxamide nitrogen has undergone formal condensation with the sulfonic acid group of 2-(trifluoromethoxy)benzenesulfonic acid. An acetolactate synthase inhibitor, it is used (generally as the corresponding sodium salt, flucarbazone-sodium) to control grass weeds in cereal crops. It has a role as an agrochemical, an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor and a herbicide. It is a N-sulfonylurea, a member of triazoles, an aromatic ether and an organofluorine compound. It is a conjugate acid of a flucarbazone(1-).
