The molecule is an N-glycosyl-1,3,5-triazine that is 4-amino-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one substituted by a beta-D-ribofuranosyl residue via an N-glycosidic linkage. An antineoplastic agent, it is used in the treatment of myeloid leukaemia. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent. It is a N-glycosyl-1,3,5-triazine and a nucleoside analogue. It derives from a beta-D-ribose.
