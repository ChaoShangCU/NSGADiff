The molecule is an aromatic amide obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-oxazole-5-carboxylic acid with the aromatic amino group of 4-fluoro-3-[6-(pyridin-2-yl)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-2-yl]aniline. A proteasome inhibitor known to be active against the three parasites that cause Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and sleeping sickness. It has a role as a proteasome inhibitor and an antileishmanial agent. It is a member of triazolopyrimidines, a member of pyridines, a member of monofluorobenzenes, a member of 1,3-oxazoles, a ring assembly and an aromatic amide.
