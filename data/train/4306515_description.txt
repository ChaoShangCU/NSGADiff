The molecule is a member of the class of pyrazoles that is 1H-pyrazole which is substituted at positions 1, 3 and 5 by 4-methoxyphenyl, trifluoromethyl and 4-chlorophenyl groups, respectively. Unlike many members of the diaryl heterocycle class of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, SC-560 is selective for COX-1. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, an apoptosis inducer, an antineoplastic agent and an angiogenesis modulating agent. It is a member of pyrazoles, an organofluorine compound, an aromatic ether and a member of monochlorobenzenes.
