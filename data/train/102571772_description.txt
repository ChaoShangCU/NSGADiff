The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acid anion that is the conjugate base of (13R)-hydroxy-(7Z,10Z,14E,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid, arising from deprotonation of the carboxylic acid group; major species at pH 7.3. It is an intermediate in 13-series resolvins biosynthesis from DPA (omega-3). It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It derives from a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoate. It is a conjugate base of a (7Z,10Z,13R,14E,16Z,19Z)-13-hydroxydocosapentaenoic acid.
