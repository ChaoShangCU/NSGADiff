The molecule is an amino trisaccharide consisting of alpha-L-fucopyranosyl, 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucosyl and D-mannopyranosyl residues linked in sequence by (1->3) and (1->2) glycosidic linkeages. It is an amino trisaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from an alpha-L-Fucp-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc.
