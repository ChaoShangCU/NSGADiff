The molecule is a triterpenoid saponin that is cycloastragenol glycosylated at positions 3 and 6 by 2-O-acetyl-beta-D-xylosyl and beta-D-glucosyl residues respectively. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a member of oxolanes, a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a triterpenoid saponin. It derives from a cycloastragenol.
