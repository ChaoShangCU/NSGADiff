The molecule is a glycosyloxyisoflavone that is genistein attached to a alpha-L-6-deoxy-talopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Kitasatospora kifunensis, it exhibits antifungal activity. It has a role as a metabolite, an antifungal agent, an anti-inflammatory agent and a NF-kappaB inhibitor. It is a glycosyloxyisoflavone, a hydroxyisoflavone and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a genistein.
