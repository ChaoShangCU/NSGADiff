The molecule is a member of the class of 2-benzofurans that is 2-benzofuran-1(3H)-one which is substituted at positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 by methyl, methoxy, (2E)-5-carboxy-3-methylpent-2-en-1-yl, and hydroxy groups, respectively. It is an antibiotic produced by Penicillium brevi-compactum, P. stoloniferum, P. echinulatum and related species. An immunosuppressant, it is widely used (partiularly as its sodium salt and as the 2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethyl ester prodrug, mycophenolate mofetil) to prevent tissue rejection following organ transplants and for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antimicrobial agent, an EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP dehydrogenase) inhibitor, an immunosuppressive agent, a mycotoxin, a Penicillium metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and an anticoronaviral agent. It is a gamma-lactone, a member of phenols, a monocarboxylic acid and a member of 2-benzofurans. It derives from a hex-4-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a mycophenolate.
