The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z)-3-oxotriacontahexaenoyl-CoA. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and an ultra-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (12Z,15Z,18Z,21Z,24Z,27Z)-3-oxotriacontahexaenoyl-CoA.
