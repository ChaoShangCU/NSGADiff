The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid that is 1,3-thiazolidine which is substituted on the nitrogen by a carboxymethyl group, at positions 2 and 4 by thioxo and oxo groups, respectively, and at position 5 by a 2-methyl-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-ylidene group. It is an inhibitor of aldose reductase (which catalyses the conversion of glucose to sorbitol) and is used for the treatment of some diabetic complications, including neuropathy. It has a role as an EC 1.1.1.21 (aldehyde reductase) inhibitor. It is a member of thiazolidines and a monocarboxylic acid.
