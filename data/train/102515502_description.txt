The molecule is an acyclic mixed acid anhydride that results from the formal condensation of the phosphoryl group of AMP with the carboxy group of 17-(4-hydroxyphenyl)heptadecanoic acid. It is an adenosine 5'-phosphate, an acyclic mixed acid anhydride and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate. It derives from an adenosine 5'-monophosphate and a 17-(4-hydroxyphenyl)heptadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 17-(4-hydroxyphenyl)heptadecanoyl-AMP(1-).
