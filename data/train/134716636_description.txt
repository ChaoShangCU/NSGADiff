The molecule is a sesquiterpenoid that is (S)-beta-macrocarpen-15-ol in which the hydroxy group has been oxidised to an aldehyde group. The second step in the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene phytoalexin zealexin A1 from (S)-beta-macrocarpene in maize. It is a sesquiterpenoid and an aldehyde. It derives from a (S)-beta-macrocarpen-15-ol.
