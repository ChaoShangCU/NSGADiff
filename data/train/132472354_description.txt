The molecule is a docosanoid anion obtained by deprotonation of the two carboxy groups and protonation of the alpha-amino group of (8S)-glycinylcystein-S-yl-(7R,17S)-dihydroxy-(4Z,9,11,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid; major species at pH 7.3. It is a dicarboxylic acid monoanion, a docosanoid anion and a peptide anion. It is a conjugate base of an (8S)-glycinylcystein-S-yl-(7R,17S)-dihydroxy-(4Z,9,11,13Z,15E,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid.
