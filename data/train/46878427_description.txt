The molecule is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion that is the dianion resulting from the removal of the proton from both of the carboxylic acid groups of luteolin-7-O-[beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucuronide]. It is a carbohydrate acid derivative anion and a flavonoid oxoanion. It is a conjugate base of a luteolin-7-O-[beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucuronide]. It is a conjugate acid of a luteolin 7-O-[(beta-D-glucosiduronate)-(1->2)-(beta-D-glucosiduronate)](3-).
