The molecule is a kaempferol O-glucoside that is the hepta acetate ester derivative of astragalin. Isolated from the aerial parts of Delphinium staphisagria, it exhibits trypanocidal activity. It has a role as a metabolite, a trypanocidal drug and a plant metabolite. It is a beta-D-glucoside, an acetate ester, a kaempferol O-glucoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside.
