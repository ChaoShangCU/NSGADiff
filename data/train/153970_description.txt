The molecule is a nucleoside analogue resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of hexadecanoic acid with the amino group of CNDAC. It is the prodrug of CNDAC and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It has a role as an antimetabolite, an antineoplastic agent, a prodrug and a DNA synthesis inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue, a nitrile and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a hexadecanoic acid and a CNDAC.
