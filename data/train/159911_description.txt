The molecule is an aromatic ether resulting from oxidative dimerisation between the 4-hydroxy group of one molecule of (1R)-1-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-6-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-7-ol and the 3-position of the 4-hydroxybenzyl group of another. It is a member of phenols, a tertiary amino compound, an aromatic ether and a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid. It derives from a dauricine.
