The molecule is a 3beta-hydroxy-4alpha-formyl-4beta-methylsteroid that is 24-methylene-9beta-9,19-cyclolanostane-3beta,28-diol in which the hydroxy group at position 28 has been oxidised to give the corresponding aldehyde. It is a member of phytosterols, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a 3beta-hydroxy-4alpha-formyl-4beta-methylsteroid and a lanostane sterol. It derives from a 24-methylene-9beta-9,19-cyclolanostane-3beta,28-diol.
