The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that consists of myricetin attached to a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 3 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Myrica cerifera, it exhibits anti-allergic activity. It has a role as an anti-allergic agent, an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor, an EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a pentahydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone, an alpha-L-rhamnoside and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from a myricetin. It is a conjugate acid of a myricitrin(1-).
