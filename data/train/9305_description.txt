The molecule is a diiodotyrosine that is L-tyrosine carrying iodo-substituents at positions C-3 and C-5 of the benzyl group. It is an intermediate in the thyroid hormone synthesis. It has a role as a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a L-tyrosine derivative, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a diiodotyrosine. It is a conjugate acid of a 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosinate(1-).
