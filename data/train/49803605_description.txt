The molecule is an aromatic ketone that is phloroglucinol in which two of the hydrogens attached to the benzene ring have been replaced by a chloro and hexanoyl groups. It is an intermediate biosynthetic precursor for differentiation-inducing factor 1 (DIF-1) which is a major inducer of stalk cell differentiation. It has a role as a eukaryotic metabolite. It is a benzenetriol, an aromatic ketone and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It is a conjugate acid of a (3-chloro-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)hexan-1-one(1-).
