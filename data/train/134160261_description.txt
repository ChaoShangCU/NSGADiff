The molecule is a glucosinolic acid that is glucoraphenin in which the hydroxy hydrogen at position 6 on the glucose fragment has been replaced by a sinapoyl group. It has a role as an Arabidopsis thaliana metabolite. It is a glucosinolic acid, a sulfoxide and a cinnamate ester. It derives from a glucoraphenin and a trans-sinapic acid.
