The molecule is a member of the class of N-acylpiperazines obtained by formal condensation of the carboxy group of 2-fluoro-5-[(4-oxo-3,4-dihydrophthalazin-1-yl)methyl]benzoic acid with the free amino group of N-(cyclpropylcarbonyl)piperazine; used to treat advanced ovarian cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an EC 2.4.2.30 (NAD(+) ADP-ribosyltransferase) inhibitor and an apoptosis inducer. It is a N-acylpiperazine, a member of cyclopropanes, a member of monofluorobenzenes and a member of phthalazines.
