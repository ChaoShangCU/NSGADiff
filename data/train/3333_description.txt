The molecule is the mixed (methyl, ethyl) diester of 4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid. A calcium-channel blocker, it lowers blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance through a highly selective action on smooth muscle in arteriolar resistance vessels. It is used in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris. It has a role as a calcium channel blocker, an antihypertensive agent, a vasodilator agent and an anti-arrhythmia drug. It is a dihydropyridine, a dichlorobenzene, an ethyl ester and a methyl ester.
