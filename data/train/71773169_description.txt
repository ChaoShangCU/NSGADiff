The molecule is a rebaudioside that is rebaudioside A in which the hydroxy group at position 2 of the beta-D-glucosyl ester moiety has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucoside. Found in minute quantities in the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana. It has a role as a sweetening agent. It is a tetracyclic diterpenoid, a rebaudioside and a sophoroside. It derives from a rebaudioside A, a rebaudioside E and a beta-D-Glcp-(1->2)-[beta-D-Glcp-(1->3)]-beta-D-Glcp.
