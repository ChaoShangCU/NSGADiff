The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol attached to a 5-O-acetyl-alpha-D-apiofuranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkages. Isolated from the aerial parts of Vicia faba and Lotus edulis, it exhibits inhibitory activity against topoisomerse I and II. It has a role as an EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA topoisomerase) inhibitor, an EC 5.99.1.3 [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing)] inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, an acetate ester, an alpha-L-rhamnoside and a dihydroxyflavone. It derives from a kaempferol.
