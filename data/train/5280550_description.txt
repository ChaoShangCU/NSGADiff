The molecule is a beta-D-glucoside resulting from the formal condensation of the phenolic hydroxy group of trans-sinapic acid with beta-D-gucopyranose. It is a dimethoxybenzene, a monosaccharide derivative, a methoxycinnamic acid and a beta-D-glucoside. It derives from a trans-sinapic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-trans-sinapate.
