The molecule is the chloride salt of bethanechol. A slowly hydrolysed muscarinic agonist with no nicotinic effects, it is used to increase smooth muscle tone, as in the gastrointestinal tract following abdominal surgery, treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and as an alternative to catheterisation in the treatment of non-obstructive urinary retention. It has a role as a muscarinic agonist. It is a carbamate ester, a quaternary ammonium salt and a chloride salt. It contains a bethanechol.
