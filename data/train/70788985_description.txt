The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide comprising alpha-N-glycoloylneuraminyl, beta-D-galactosyl and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine residues linked sequentially (2->3) and (1->4), to the galactosyl residue of which is also linked (1->3) an alpha-L-fucosyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
