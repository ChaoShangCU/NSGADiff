The molecule is an oligosaccharide sulfate consisting of 2-O-sulfo-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronic acid and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose residues joined in sequence by a (1->4) glycosidic linkage. It is a member of acetamides, an amino disaccharide, a monocarboxylic acid, an oligosaccharide sulfate, an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and an enol. It derives from a N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine.
