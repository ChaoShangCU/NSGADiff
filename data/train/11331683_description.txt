The molecule is a ginsenoside found in Panax ginseng that is dammarane which is substituted by hydroxy groups at the 3beta, 12beta and 20 pro-S positions and in which the hydroxy group at position 20 has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-xylopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a plant metabolite. It is a ginsenoside, a tetracyclic triterpenoid, a beta-D-glucoside, a disaccharide derivative and a 3beta-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylsteroid. It derives from a (20S)-protopanaxadiol. It derives from a hydride of a dammarane.
