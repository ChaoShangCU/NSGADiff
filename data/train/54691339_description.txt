The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 1,4-dihydroxypyridin-2(1H)-one substituted by a cis-1,4-dihydroxycyclohexyl group at position 5 and a (2E,4E,6E,8R,10R)-6,8,10-trimethyldodeca-2,4,6-trienoyl moiety at position 3. It is isolated from the mycelium of the entomogenous fungus, Paecilomyces militaris and has been found to induce pronounced neurite sprouting. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a pyridone, an enone, a secondary alcohol, a tertiary alcohol, a dihydroxypyridine, a pyridine alkaloid and an aromatic ketone.
