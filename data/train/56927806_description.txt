The molecule is the ketoaldonic acid phosphate formed formally from L-erythronic acid by oxidation of the 3-hydroxy group to an oxo group and phosphorylation at the 1-hydroxy group. It derives from a L-erythronic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (S)-2-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-(phosphonatooxy)butanoate(3-). It is an enantiomer of a (R)-2-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-(phosphonooxy)butanoic acid.
