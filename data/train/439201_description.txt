The molecule is a linear nonapeptide messenger belonging to the kinin group of proteins, with amino acid sequence RPPGFSPFR. Enzymatically produced from kallidin in the blood, it is a powerful vasodilator that causes smooth muscle contraction, and may mediate inflammation. It has a role as a human blood serum metabolite and a vasodilator agent. It is a tautomer of a bradykinin(2+).
