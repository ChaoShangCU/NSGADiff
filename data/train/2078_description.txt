The molecule is an aromatic amide that is N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)acetamide substituted by a methoxymethyl group at at the nitrogen atom while one of the hydrogens of the methyl group has been replaced by a chlorine atom. It has a role as a herbicide, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is an organochlorine compound, a monocarboxylic acid amide and an aromatic amide. It derives from a N-phenylacetamide.
