The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z)-3-oxohexacosahexaenoic acid. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA, an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of an (8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z,20Z,23Z)-3-oxohexacosahexaenoyl-CoA(4-).
