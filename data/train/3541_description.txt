The molecule is a member of the class of isoquinolines that is the sulfonamide obtained by formal condensation of the sulfo group of isoquinoline-5-sulfonic acid with the primary amino group of N(1)-[3-(4-bromophenyl)prop-2-en-1-yl]ethane-1,2-diamine. It has a role as an EC 2.7.11.11 (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) inhibitor. It is a member of isoquinolines, a sulfonamide, a member of bromobenzenes, an olefinic compound and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a N-[2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]isoquinoline-5-sulfonamide(2+).
