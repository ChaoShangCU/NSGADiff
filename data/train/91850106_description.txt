The molecule is a branched amino tetrasaccharide that is beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-GalpNAc in which position 3 of the non-terminal 2-acetamido-beta-D-glucopyranoysyl residue has been glycosylated by an alpha-L-fucosyl group (6-deoxy-alpha-L-galactosyl group). It is an amino tetrasaccharide and a member of acetamides. It derives from a beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)-D-GalpNAc.
