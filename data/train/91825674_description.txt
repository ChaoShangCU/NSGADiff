The molecule is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate OH groups of (3E)-nonenoyl-CoA major species at pH 7.3. It is a trans-3-enoyl-CoA(4-), a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (3E)-nonenoyl-CoA.
