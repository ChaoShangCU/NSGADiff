The molecule is a maleate salt obtained by reaction of N-methylquipazine with two equivalents of maleic acid. A 5-HT3 agonist. Has almost the same affinity for 5-HT3 sites as quipazine but unlike the latter, does not bind to 5-HT1B sites. It has a role as a prodrug and a serotonergic agonist. It contains a N-methylquipazine.
