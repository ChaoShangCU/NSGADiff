The molecule is an organic sodium salt that is a monosodium salt of eurysterol A sulfonic acid. Isolated from an undescribed marine sponge of the genus Euryspongia collected in Palau, it is cytotoxic and exhibits antifungal activity against both amphotericin B-resistant and wild-type strains of Candida albicans. It has a role as a metabolite, an antifungal agent and an antineoplastic agent. It contains a eurysterol A(1-). It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-cholestane.
