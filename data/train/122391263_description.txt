The molecule is a tricarboxylic acid that is hexa-2,4-dienedioic acid which is substituted at position 3 by a 2-carboxy-1-hydroxyethyl group (the 2Z,4E isomer; a mixture of isomers at the carbon bearing the alcoholic hydroxy group). It has been produced from trans-caffeic acid using Aspergillus niger, but the conversion rate was increased 3.5 times by using a coculture of Streptomyces coelicolor and Aspergillus niger. It has a role as an Aspergillus metabolite. It is a tricarboxylic acid, a secondary alcohol and an olefinic compound.
