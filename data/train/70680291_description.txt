The molecule is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA obtained from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 3-oxoisooctadecanoic acid. It is a methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoA, an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-oxoisooctadecanoyl-CoA(4-).
