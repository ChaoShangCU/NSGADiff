The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is apigenin substituted by a beta-D-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a metabolite and an antibacterial agent. It is a beta-D-glucoside, a dihydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone and a monosaccharide derivative. It derives from an apigenin. It is a conjugate acid of an apigenin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside(1-). It is an enantiomer of an apigenin 7-O-beta-L-glucoside.
