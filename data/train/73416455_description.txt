The molecule is a methyl-branched fatty acid that is heptadecanoic (margaric) acid bearing a methyl substituent at position 2 (the S-enantiomer). It is a methyl-branched fatty acid, a branched-chain saturated fatty acid and a long-chain fatty acid. It derives from a heptadecanoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (2S)-2-methylheptadecanoate.
