The molecule is an amino disaccharide consisting of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-sulfo-beta-D-galactopyranose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose joined in sequence by a (1->4) glycosidic bond. It is an amino disaccharide, an oligosaccharide sulfate, a member of acetamides and a glucosamine oligosaccharide. It derives from a N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosamine 4-sulfate and a N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
