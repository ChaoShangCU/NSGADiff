The molecule is a hydroxy-cannabidiol that is cannabidiol in which the methyl group that is attached to the double bond of the cyclohexene ring has been oxidised to the corresponding hydroxymethyl group. It is one of the main metabolites of cannabidiol by human liver microsomes, produced particularly by CYP2C19. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a hydroxy-cannabidiol, an olefinic compound, a member of resorcinols and a primary alcohol.
