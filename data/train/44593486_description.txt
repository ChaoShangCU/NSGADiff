The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is chrysoeriol in which the hydroxyl hydrogen at position 7 is replaced by an alpha-L-rhamnosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl moiety. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a dihydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from a 4',5,7-trihydroxy-3'-methoxyflavone.
