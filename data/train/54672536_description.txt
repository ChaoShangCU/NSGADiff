The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is kaempferol attached to alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl residue at position 3 and a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl residue at position 7 via glycosidic linkages. It has been isolated from the whole plant of Anthyllis hermanniae. It has a role as a metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a glycosyloxyflavone, an alpha-L-rhamnoside, an alpha-L-arabinopyranoside and a dihydroxyflavone. It derives from a kaempferol.
