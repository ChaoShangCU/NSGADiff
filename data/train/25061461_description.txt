The molecule is a linear amino trisaccharide consisting of a galactosyl residue at the non-reducing end linked beta-(1->3) to an N-acetylgalactosaminyl residue, which is in turn linked beta-(1->3) to a beta-galactose unit at the reducing end. It is an amino trisaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
