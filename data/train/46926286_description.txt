The molecule is an L-alanine derivative obtained by formal condensation of one of the carboxy groups of fumaric acid with the side-chain amino group of 3-amino-L-alanine. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite. It is an enamide, a L-alanine derivative, a dicarboxylic acid monoamide, a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a secondary carboxamide. It derives from a 3-amino-L-alanine and a fumaric acid. It is a conjugate acid of a N(3)-fumaroyl-(S)-2,3-diaminopropanoate.
