The molecule is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-) arising from deprotonation of the phosphate and diphosphate functions of (17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z)-3-oxodotriacontatetraenoyl-CoA. It is a 3-oxo-fatty acyl-CoA(4-), an 11,12-saturated fatty acyl-CoA(4-) and an ultra-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA(4-). It is a conjugate base of a (17Z,20Z,23Z,26Z)-3-oxodotriacontatetraenoyl-CoA.
