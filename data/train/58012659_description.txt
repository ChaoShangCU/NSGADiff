The molecule is a semisynthetic cyclic hexapeptide echinocandin antibiotic which exerts its effect by inhibiting the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an integral component of the fungal cell wall. It has a role as an antiinfective agent. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide, an echinocandin, a semisynthetic derivative and an antibiotic antifungal drug. It derives from a pneumocandin B0.
