The molecule is a dicarboxylic acid monoester resulting from the formal condensation of one of the carboxylic acid groups of crocetin with the anomeric hydroxy group of beta-D-gentiobiose. It is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, a glycoside and a disaccharide derivative. It derives from a crocetin and a gentiobiose. It is a conjugate acid of a beta-D-gentiobiosyl crocetin(1-).
