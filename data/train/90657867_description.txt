The molecule is a fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (Z)-hex-3-enoic acid. It is a cis-3-enoyl-CoA, a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a cis-hex-3-enoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (Z)-hex-3-enoyl-CoA(4-).
