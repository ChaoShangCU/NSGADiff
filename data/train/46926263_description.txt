The molecule is a cis-2-enoyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the enoic carboxy group of (Z)-hex-2-enedioic acid. It is a cis-2-enoyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a 2-hexenedioic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (Z)-2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA(5-).
