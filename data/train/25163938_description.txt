The molecule is a notoamide that is 7,7-dimethyl-1,7-dihydropyrano[2,3-g]indol-2(3H)-one which is substituted at position 3 by 3-methylbut-1-en-3-yl and [(3S,8aS)-1,4-dioxooctahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl]methyl groups (the all-S stereoisomer). Isolated from a mussel-derived Aspergillus species. It has a role as an antifouling biocide, an Aspergillus metabolite and a mycotoxin. It is a dipeptide, an indole alkaloid, a pyrrolopyrazine, a notoamide and an organic heterotricyclic compound.
