The molecule is a tetracyclic diterpenoid that is 10-deacetylbaccatin III having O-methyl groups attached at positions 7 and 10 as well as an O-(2R,3S)-3-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl group attached at position 13. Acts as a microtubule inhibitor, binds tubulin and promotes microtubule assembly and simultaneously inhibits disassembly. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-stabilising agent. It derives from a 10-deacetylbaccatin III.
