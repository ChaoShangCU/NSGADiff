The molecule is a monocarboxylic acid that is propionic acid in which one of the hydrogens at position 2 is substituted by a 4-[(2-hydroxycyclopentyl)methyl]phenyl group (the 2S,1'R,2'S-stereoisomer. The active metabolite of loxoprofen. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, an antipyretic, a xenobiotic metabolite, a human metabolite and a drug metabolite. It is a monocarboxylic acid and a member of cyclopentanols. It derives from a propionic acid and a loxoprofen.
