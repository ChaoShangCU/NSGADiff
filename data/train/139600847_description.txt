The molecule is a tetrasaccharide derivative consisting of a beta-D-glucosyl residue glycosidically linked to a 5-aminopentyl group and which carries at O-3 a 2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-3-O-methyl-alpha-L-talosyl-(1->3)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->3)-2-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-alpha-L-talosyl trisaccharide unit. It is a tetrasaccharide derivative and a glycoside.
