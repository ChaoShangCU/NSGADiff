The molecule is a methyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 3,5-di-O-caffeoyl quinic acid with methanol. Isolated from Suaeda glauca and Dichrocephala bicolor, it exhibits hepatoprotective activity. It has a role as a metabolite and a hepatoprotective agent. It is a methyl ester, a tertiary alcohol, a member of catechols, a cinnamate ester and a secondary alcohol. It derives from a 3,5-di-O-caffeoyl quinic acid.
