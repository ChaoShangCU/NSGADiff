The molecule is a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (15Z)-tetracosenoic acid. It is a very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and a monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from a (15Z)-tetracosenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (15Z)-tetracosenoyl-CoA(4-).
