The molecule is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the n-6 PUFA and is the product of linoleic acid metabolism. It is an unsaturated fatty acyl-CoA and a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA. It derives from an all-cis-docosa-7,10,13,16-tetraenoic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a (7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)-docosatetraenoyl-CoA(4-).
