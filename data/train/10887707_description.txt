The molecule is a cyclosporin A derivative that is cyclosporin A in which the residue-9 N-methylleucine moiety has undergone oxidation so as to introduce a hydroxy group at the carbon bearing the two methyl groups, while the residue-4 N-methylleucine moiety has undergone N-demethylation. It has a role as a drug metabolite. It is a cyclosporin A derivative and a tertiary alcohol. It derives from a cyclosporin A metabolite M1 and a cyclosporin A metabolite M21.
