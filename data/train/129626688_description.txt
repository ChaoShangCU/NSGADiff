The molecule is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine in which the acyl group is specified as (5Z,13E,15S)-11alpha,15-dihydroxy-9-oxoprosta-5,13-dien-1-oyl It has a role as a mouse metabolite and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and a prostanoid. It derives from a prostaglandin E2. It is a tautomer of a 2-[(5Z,13E,15S)-11alpha,15-dihydroxy-9-oxoprosta-5,13-dien-1-oyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine zwitterion.
