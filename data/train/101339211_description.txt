The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is apigenin substituted by a beta-L-glucopyranosyl moiety at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. It is a dihydroxyflavone, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a beta-L-glucoside. It derives from an apigenin. It is an enantiomer of an apigenin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside.
