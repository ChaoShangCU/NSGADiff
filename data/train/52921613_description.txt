The molecule is an amino tetrasaccharide in which a galactose residue is linked beta(1->3) to the residue at the reducing end of a linear chain of one galactose residue, one N-acetylglucosamine residue and one N-acetylgalactosamine residue, sequentially linked beta(1->4) and beta(1->6). It has a role as an epitope. It is a galactosamine oligosaccharide, an amino tetrasaccharide, a glucosamine oligosaccharide and a beta-D-Galp-(1->3)-[beta-D-Galp-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1->6)]-D-GalpNAc.
