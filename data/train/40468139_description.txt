The molecule is a D-alpha-amino acid anion which is obtained from (3R)-3-hydroxy-D-aspartic acid by formal deprotonation of both carboxyl groups and protonation of the amino group. It is a D-alpha-amino acid anion and a dicarboxylic acid anion. It is a conjugate base of a (3R)-3-hydroxy-D-aspartic acid. It is an enantiomer of a (3S)-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate(1-).
