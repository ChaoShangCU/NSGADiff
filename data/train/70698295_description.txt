The molecule is a quercetin O-glycoside that consists of quercetin substituted by a alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1->6)-beta-D-galactopyranosyl residue at position 7 via a glycosidic linkage. Isolated from Grevillea, it exhibits antimalarial activity. It has a role as a metabolite and an antimalarial. It is a disaccharide derivative and a quercetin O-glycoside.
