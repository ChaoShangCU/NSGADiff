The molecule is a flavin mononucleotide obtained by prenylation of the N-10 position of FMNH2 followed by cyclisation. An essential cofactor for the decarboxylase enzymes UbiD and Fdc1. It has a role as a cofactor and an Escherichia coli metabolite. It is an organic heterotetracyclic compound and a flavin mononucleotide. It derives from a FMNH2 and a D-ribitol 5-phosphate. It is a conjugate acid of a prenyl-FMNH2(2-).
