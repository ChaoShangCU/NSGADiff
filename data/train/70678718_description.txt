The molecule is a seven-membered branched galactosamine oligosaccharide that consists of a branched tetrasaccharide unit alpha-Neu5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-[alpha-L-Fuc-(1->3)]-beta-D-GlcNAc, attached by a glycosidic linkage to position 6 of the GalNAc residue of the trisaccharide alpha-Neu5Ac-(2->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-D-GalNAc. It has a role as an epitope. It is a galactosamine oligosaccharide and a glucosamine oligosaccharide.
