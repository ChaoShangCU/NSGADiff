The molecule is a dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DiHDPE) that is (7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid in which the hydrogens at the 10 pro-R and 17 pro-S positions have been replaced by hydroxy groups. It is an intermediate of specialized proresolving mediators. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a specialised pro-resolving mediator. It is a conjugate acid of a (10R,17S)-dihydroxy-(7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoate.
