The molecule is a pyridine alkaloid that is 2,2'-bipyridine-6-carbonitrile substituted by a methoxy group at position 4. Isolated from the marine-derived actinomycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus, it exhibits antineoplastic activity. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a bacterial metabolite and a marine metabolite. It is an aromatic ether, a member of bipyridines, a pyridine alkaloid and a nitrile. It derives from a hydride of a 2,2'-bipyridine.
