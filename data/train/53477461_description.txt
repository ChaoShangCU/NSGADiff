The molecule is a hydroperoxyicosapentaenoic acid that is (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoic acid in which the pro-R hydrogen at position 18 has been replaced by a hydroperoxy group. One of the two stereoisomers formed when acetylated COX2 oxidises the omega-3 fatty acid EPA. It derives from an all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoic acid.
