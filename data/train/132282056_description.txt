The molecule is a pyrrolizine alkaloid that is erucifoline in which the primary hydroxy hydrogen has been replaced by an acetyl group and the tertiary amino function has been oxidised to the corresponding N-oxide. It has a role as a Jacobaea metabolite. It is an acetate ester, an epoxide, a macrocyclic lactone, an olefinic compound, an organic heteropentacyclic compound, a pyrrolizine alkaloid and a tertiary amine oxide. It derives from an erucifoline.
