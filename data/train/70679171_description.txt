The molecule is a branched pentasaccharide consisting of a linear sequence of beta-D-galactose, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, beta-D-mannose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues linked (1->4), (1->3) and (1->4), to the galactose residue of which is (1->6)-linked an N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl residue. It has a role as an epitope. It is a glucosamine oligosaccharide and an amino pentasaccharide.
