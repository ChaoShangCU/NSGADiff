The molecule is a furanocoumarin that is 2,3-dihydrofuro[3,2-c]coumarin substituted by a methoxy group at position 7, methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 (relatively cis configuration) and a 4-methyl-5-(4-methyl-2-furyl)-3(E)-pentenyl moiety at position 2. Isolated from the roots of Ferula fukanensis and Ferula ferulioides, it exhibits inhibitory activity against production of nitric oxide (NO). It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 1.14.13.39 (nitric oxide synthase) inhibitor. It is a furanocoumarin, a sesquiterpenoid, an aromatic ether and a member of furans.
