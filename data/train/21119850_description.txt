The molecule is a pentol that is (3S,5R,10R,12S,14S,15R,16R)-12,16-dimethylicosane-3,5,10,14,15-pentol in which the pro-S hydrogen at position 2 is substituted by an amino group. It results from hydrolysis of the O-acyl bonds of fumonisin B1. It is a pentol and a primary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a (2S,3S,5R,10R,12S,14S,15R,16R)-2-amino-12,16-dimethylicosane-3,5,10,14,15-pentol(1+).
