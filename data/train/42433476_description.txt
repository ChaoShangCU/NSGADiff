The molecule is a glycosyloxyflavone that is isorhamnetin substituted at position 3 by a beta-L-galactosyl residue. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a beta-L-galactoside, a glycosyloxyflavone, a monomethoxyflavone, a monosaccharide derivative and a trihydroxyflavone. It derives from an isorhamnetin and a beta-L-galactose.
