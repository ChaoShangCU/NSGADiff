The molecule is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is (6E,8Z,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoic acid substituted at positions 5 and 18 by hydroperoxy and hydroxy groups respectively (the 5S, 18S-stereoisomer). It has a role as a human blood serum metabolite and a human xenobiotic metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a (5S)-hydroperoxy-(18S)-hydroxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z,16E)-icosapentaenoate.
