The molecule is a flavanone glycoside that is (+)-taxifolin substituted by an alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl residue at position 3. It has a role as a metabolite. It is an alpha-L-arabinofuranoside, a member of 3'-hydroxyflavanones, a flavanone glycoside, a monosaccharide derivative, a tetrahydroxyflavanone and a member of 4'-hydroxyflavanones. It derives from an alpha-L-arabinofuranose and a (+)-taxifolin.
