The molecule is a steroidal acyl-CoA that results from the formal condensation of the thiol group of coenzyme A with the carboxy group of 12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dien-24-oic acid. It derives from a 12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dien-24-oic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dien-24-oyl-CoA(4-).
