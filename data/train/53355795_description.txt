The molecule is a steroid saponin that is ergosta-7,24(28)-diene-21-thioic S-acid attached to an acetyloxy group at position 2, an alpha-L-quinovopyranosyloxy group at position 3 and a methyl group at position 4 (the 2alpha,3beta,4alpha,5alpha stereoisomer). It has been isolated from the roots of Breynia fruticosa. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an acetate ester, a deoxyglucose derivative, a monosaccharide derivative, a steroid ester, a steroid saponin, a monothiocarboxylic acid and a steroid acid.
