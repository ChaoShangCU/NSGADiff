The molecule is a member of the class of pyrazoles that is 1,3-dimethylpyrazole which is substituted at positions 4 and 5 by 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl and p-tosyloxy groups, respectively. It is an obsolete proherbicide (via hydrolysis of the tosylate group to afford the corresponding 5-hydroxypyrazole), that was used to control weeds in rice paddy fields. It has a role as a proherbicide, an EC 1.13.11.27 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitor, an agrochemical and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a member of pyrazoles, a tosylate ester, an aromatic ketone and a dichlorobenzene.
